            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Rival Princesses: OR, THE Colchian Court.</head>
            <p>IT has been often observed, that there is nothing so Universal as Love; and that there are no People, how bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous soever, but it gives Laws unto. A famous Example of this we have in the late Transactions of the Kingdom of <hi>Colchis,</hi> where it made appear the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menseness of its Power, and how uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable and capricious a God he is that prefides over the Hearts and the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Colchis</hi> is situated at the end of the <hi>Black-Sea;</hi> to the East it is inclosed with an Island that makes a part of <hi>Georgia,</hi> which by the people of the Country is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:151309:3"/> called <hi>Imicerta,</hi> by the Ancients <hi>Iberia.</hi> To the South, by the <hi>Black-Sea;</hi> to the West, by the Kingdom of the <hi>Abcas;</hi> the <hi>Corox</hi> and <hi>Phosis,</hi> Famous Rivers in Ancient History, serve for its Bounds. The Ancient Kingdom of <hi>Colchis</hi> was larger than it is now; it was formerly fortified against the <hi>Abcas</hi> by a Wall sixty Miles in length, which has been laid in Ruines these many years; so that now the thick Forests are its chiefest Defence, and greatest Security. The <hi>Air</hi> is Temperate, as well in respect of the Heat as Cold. The <hi>Nobility</hi> spend almost their whole time in the Field. They do not build by <hi>Cities,</hi> and by <hi>Towns,</hi> nor is there more than two Villages in all the whole Kin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and those by the Sea-side, for Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick, and the convenience of Commerce; but the whole Country is so thick set with <hi>Houses,</hi> that you will hardly travel five Miles without seeing three or four together; whereas in other Countries there are often found Heaths and Defarts of a very large extent, wholly un-inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, and which are in many places un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passable. In <hi>Colchis</hi> there are nine or ten <hi>Castles,</hi> the chiefest of which is called, the Castle of <hi>Kuc</hi>'s, where the <hi>Prince of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151309:3"/> Colchis</hi> keeps his <hi>Court.</hi> The Castle is moated and surrounded with a stone Wall, in which there are a great many Pieces of Canon placed for its Defence.</p>
            <p>The Men are very well shaped, and the Women very handsome; they have their Features very regular. In those that are of any Quality is to be found a Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Air; all their Address is so obliging, that they insensibly win our Affection, and seem to Command our Love. They dress themselves with all the Curiosity imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. Their Habit is like that of the <hi>Persians,</hi> but the dress of their Hair after the manner of the <hi>European Women.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Arms are a <hi>Lance, Bow</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,</hi> a <hi>streight Sword,</hi> a <hi>Mace,</hi> and <hi>Buckler:</hi> there are but few carry <hi>Fire-Arms;</hi> they are very good <hi>Soldiers,</hi> sit a <hi>Horse</hi> well, and handle their Swords with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary dexterity.</p>
            <p>I have been more particular in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the Place, because it is so little known to the <hi>Europeans;</hi> and that nothing is more certain and exact, than this Relation I have given.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Levan Dadian</hi> was the greatest <hi>Prince</hi> that ever reigned in <hi>Colchis</hi> of late Ages; he conquer'd all the Enemies that ever he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:151309:4"/> made War against, and in short, grew so formidable, that he began to be a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to all his Neighbours: He was a great Soldier, and knew the Art of War to a Miracle; his Courage was undeniable, his Magnificence surpassing all his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors; and to give his Character in a few words, had not Love too much ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannized over so great a Heart, he had ended his Reign with all the Glory ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, and with the Renown he began it; but his cruel Destiny inspired him with so wicked a Passion, that it oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and defaced the remembrance of all his other Vertues, and made him to be consider'd as the most infamous of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Levan</hi> was very young when he ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Throne, and left to the care of <hi>George, Soveraign Prince</hi> of <hi>Libardian,</hi> his Uncle, <hi>Protector</hi> of the State, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served Religiously to acquit himself of that high Trust with all imaginable Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, meriting the highest Praise for his generous Conduct to him; he honoured him with as tender an Affection, as if he had been his own Child, and always made his Advancement and Glory his chiefest study.</p>
            <p>He read him early Lessons of Glory;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:151309:4"/> gave him to know, that nothing was so admirable in a <hi>Prince</hi> as Justice and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency; and that on the contrary, nothing was so blameable as Cruelty or Lenity. He led him to Wars, taught him to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer his first Fields, and always crown'd him with Success and Glory: He learn'd to be couragious, martial, and fierce from his generous President: He began to be indefatigable in all his Undertakings; so that it was with a great deal of Pleasure the Protector saw all his Care so well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, in the Advantage the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Colchis</hi> made of his Instructions.</p>
            <p>But as a Cloud to these excellent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, he was unfortunately inspired with a Passion Incestuous and Criminal at once; he became Amorous of the Wife of the Prince his Uncle; all the ties of Blood and Gratitude were here of no other force but to engage him the more strongly: For our Appetites are often so depraved, as nothing has power to fix them but what is not allowable in us to gratifie them with; and the abhorrence which every reasonable man would have had for so injurious a Passion, was the motive that drew <hi>Levan</hi> the more strongly to it.</p>
            <p>His Ascendant was <hi>Love,</hi> and he was
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:151309:5"/> uncontroulable in all things else; nothi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> besides could govern him, he was impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of the Counsel of any but the <hi>Prince</hi> his Uncle, to whom he was obliged to yield Obedience. He never distinguished by particular favours any of his Captains or Courtiers; none was more his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite than another, but he that merited most, was best rewarded: He was so Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, that it was but rarely any of his Council durst advise him, and yet he owned an entire dependence to the God of Love, who would have it that this haughty Spirit must submit to the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of a Woman.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>George,</hi> Prince of <hi>Libardian,</hi> had espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Homais Dorejan,</hi> of the great Family of the <hi>Chickalites,</hi> a Princess more wicked, and more ambitious than any ever was: She is guilty of all the Passions a Lover's Breast can be capable of; for such are the regards of her passionate, tender, and languishing Eyes, that she never looks but to command Love, and inspire Hope. The Character of her Soul is ambitious, deceitful, cruel, and unconstant; her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations are obscene, and often tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sports her to the excess of Debauch. But before we proceed, it may be necessary to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:151309:5"/> give some account of the Life of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son who has so considerable a share in the following Narrative.</p>
            <div type="narrative">
               <head>The History of <hi>Homais.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>HOmais Dorejan,</hi> of the great Family of the <hi>Chickalites,</hi> is a Person of a most engaging Aspect: Her Hair, of which she has a great abundance, is light-brown; and though the colour of her Eyes be grey, nothing was so attracting and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating; and it was easie to see by them that the Character of her Soul was Amorous and Inconstant. The turn of her Face was Oval, nothing was purer Carnation than her Lips, or gave birth so soon to such rebellious thoughts in the beholders; to which may be added the excellency of her Teeth, which she took a perfect care to preserve: But all that has been said comes short of her Neck and Breast; no Painter ever drew so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act a symetry of Beauty, a turn till now unknown to Nature, and which was alone capable to inspire desire: Her Hands and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:151309:6"/> Arms were cast in the same Mold, and nothing could be seen more exact; her Shape was easie, though it was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, because that it was not so slender as others; she was inclin'd to fat, and would not suffer her self to be drest after that cumbersome manner which other Women use to preserve themselves in shape: The air of her Person was graceful, moving without constraint, and ever engaging. This won her a great many Hearts, which she wanted Address to improve to the most Advantage, as people do that desire to make themselves lov'd out of vanity, and not inclination: She cared not for moving those persons that she did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect some pleasure from their sensibility; and all other of her Conquest were to her incommodious. Her Soul was aspiring, and she wish'd for nothing more than a Crown; but in the mean time, since that was not yet to be had, she did not fail to gratifie her other Pleasures, amongst which, she had the greatest sense for Love and Amorous Engagements. Her Wit was astonishing, and much beyond her Judgment, which often fail'd her in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation when she had the most occasion for it. Her Contempt was general for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:151309:6"/> the Opinion of the World, and she never regulated her self by it. Her Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was pleasant, and always intermixt with Raillery, which she used in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner very becoming, and her Wit lay most that way. She had no reserve for her most intimate Acquaintance, nor could her Wit spare her the diversion she found in ridiculing their weaknesses; and yet it was impossible with all these faults for any person not to love her, or desire her conversation.</p>
               <p>Her Ascendant was Ambition, but her greatest propensity was Love; and it was not long, though in a very tender Age, before she began to experience the effects of it; but as she wanted a great part of that Resolution, which a little time lent her, she conceal'd this inclination in such a manner, as it quite extinguished in her, so that she began to love another, and then another, and so a third, before she made any discovery of it. At length, <hi>Osman,</hi> first <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Bassa</hi> in the Court of <hi>Libardian,</hi> of which <hi>George,</hi> Uncle to the Prince of <hi>Colchis,</hi> was Soveraign Prince, was made her Captive: She had likewise for him an irresistible inclination, which encouraged him in the pursuit of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:151309:7"/> his Love; she had such ways with her, such affected tendernesses, which appear'd not in her as the effects of weakness, but the discovery of a Passion too great to be conceal'd, that <hi>Osman</hi> was insensibly led into that most precipitated Land of Love: She suffer'd her Eyes to behold his, and fixing of them there in such a manner, as if it were not in her power to remove them thence; she would shew him such a Prospect of Happiness, that the most reasonable of all Men could not have avoided the Snare. But as <hi>Osman</hi> has a very particular share in this History, when as afterwards his being created <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> of <hi>Colchis,</hi> was the fatal occasion of a Passion he entertain'd for the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess</hi> thereof, and which cost him his Life. It may not be amiss to give the Reader the Character of his Person in this place, before we speak any more of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Osman</hi> was tall, exactly made, and walked with the Air of a Monarch; his Actions were noble, and his Courage ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found any thing too great for him to undertake: The colour of his Eyes were blew, sweet, passionate, and tender; his Nose was <hi>Roman,</hi> and which gave an air of greatness to the whole composure.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:151309:7"/> His Mouth was indifferently large, his under Lip swell'd to a becoming bigness, and nothing was better colour'd: His Teeth were well set, and very white. The make of his Face was Oval, and he had something there, at once very busie, and yet very sweet. His Temper was the best that could be found. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests of a Friend he always made his own, and knew not any greater pleasure than serving them effectually. He had a Passion for <hi>Homais,</hi> but it may be more properly called an Amazement, since he had no other thoughts for her than what became very transitory, and hindred him not from engaging in a Passion that was the cause of his death: But as this was not till after he had been deserted by <hi>Homais,</hi> we will consider him a while as her most passionate adorer.</p>
               <p>It is hard for us to judge which was the first of these two Persons that began to love each other. At one of the Court-Meetings, that a great Ball was danced, <hi>Homais,</hi> who became that motion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly well, was to take out the <hi>Bassa</hi> for a Dance; there was nothing done with more disorder between two Persons, and tho' they were perfectly acquainted
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:151309:8"/> with the Figure, it hindred them not from being out so often, that they were forced to part, and take out others to redeem the Credit they had lost; it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the mutual surprize they had, and they from that moment began to discern something in each other that could not be seen without concern; the <hi>Bassa</hi> sigh'd several times, and had the pleasure to hear very tender returns from <hi>Homais.</hi> In the beginning of a Passion she is very eager, and nothing is to be spared that can be conducing to the enslaving him she loves; but as soon as that is done, and she believes him past retreat, she abandons him, no longer looks upon him with desire, but carries her Charms fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the making of new Conquests.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bassa</hi> found himself at the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the Assembly, to be passionately in Love. The <hi>Sultaness</hi> his Wife had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the disorder he was in, she enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the cause of it, and he did not hesitate long in the acquainting her with it, but not with too much sincerity; for he told her, that he had found himself ill, and unable at that time to continue the Dance, tho' he did not tell her of what a nature the pain was of which he complain'd.</p>

               <p>As for what concern'd <hi>Homais,</hi> she found her self inevitably charm'd; she sigh'd, she complain'd, her Eyes were no longer so full of that fire so natural to them: She languish'd again for another sight of the <hi>Bassa,</hi> when she was told, that the <hi>Sultaness</hi> with <hi>Osman</hi> were come to visit her. In <hi>Colchis</hi> the Women have an entire Liberty, and not at all after the manner of the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> their Neighbours: They carry themselves after their own inclinations, and never submit to the capriciousness of a Husband: Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie is there less absolute than in any other place, and it is not always that a Husband talks of Poysons and Poyniards, when his Wife plays him false; they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a great deal to their natural weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, tho' for all this so celebrated Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, they are not willing to be impos'd upon, no more than the <hi>European</hi> Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands; and the Women, when they would deceive, are constrain'd to use the same precautions.</p>
               <p>A moment after the <hi>Bassa</hi> entred the Chamber, where <hi>Homais</hi> was lying on the Bed, languishing and pale: The <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taness</hi> came in also. <hi>Homais</hi> complain'd of a pain at her Heart, which the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:151309:9"/> could give no name to, and she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it would be Mortal; she said all this with her Eyes fixt upon the <hi>Bassa.</hi> He presently reply'd, that if she would venture upon a Charm that he would give her, he did not question but it would Cure her; but that faith was a necessary point, and above all things, she was not to look into it till the same time to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; she laugh'd at the seriousness of the <hi>Bassa,</hi> and tho' she had not a great Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Charms, she would try the Cure, because it came from him; and after that she assured him she would venture upon it, he call'd for Pen and Ink with some Paper, he presently set himself to write, and retiring after he had done, to a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Chamber, he put something into the Paper, which, as he said, was not to be seen by any body; and after he had neatly made it up, he ask'd for a Ribbon, which he ty'd to it, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to <hi>Homais,</hi> when he had finish'd his work, told her, that he must himself tie it about her Neck. She opposed it, as a thing contrary to decency, alledging that if the <hi>Sultaness</hi> his Wife would do her that Honour, it would be as well. If, said the <hi>Bassa,</hi> you do not resolve intirely
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:151309:9"/> to follow my Directions, the Charm will be of no effect, and it is absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that I tie it on, because that a great deal of the Vertue depends upon the manner of it: You will suffer, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, continued he, that any of your <hi>Physicians</hi> approach you in that manner, and is there any more danger in admitting me? I am more your Slave than any other, and more aw'd by the least of your frowns; therefore I beseech you, Madam, not to entertain any thing of distrust of a Man so absolutely at your Devotion. The innocent <hi>Sultaness</hi> joyn'd her supplications to the <hi>Bassa</hi>'s. I very well perceive, reply'd <hi>Homais,</hi> that it must be as you will, and that it signifies nothing for me to deny you; come, my Lord, I must submit with the best grace to what cannot be avoided: At these words she gave her Hand to the <hi>Bassa</hi> to help her to rise from the Bed, and went to her Toylet, where sitting down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Glass, she uncovered her Neck, which, as we have before delivered, was perfectly beautiful. This was a Charm that the <hi>Bassa</hi> was only acquainted with by Report, he had never seen any thing of such a dazling whiteness, nor any
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:151309:10"/> thing so well made: He approached he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, but it was with trembling, and without the power to speak. Her disorder was equal to his; he sigh'd, she returned it, and was as much surprized as he. The <hi>Sultaness</hi> was busied in looking upon those Pictures that were in the Lodging, not at all suspecting that so silent a commerce could have any thing so tender in it, and therefore did not trouble her self about it. After some moments of silence, which was past in a very expressive manner, the <hi>Bassa</hi> was the first that broke it. What a Prospect do you shew me, Madam, said he? And how impossible is it for one to help dying with Love at the sight of so many Charms? At this he ventur'd to kiss her Neck, which the <hi>Sultaness</hi> did not see, nor could <hi>Homais</hi> resist him; her Eyes were tender, her Soul warm'd with the sighs of her Lover; and if the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taness</hi> had not been there, we know not how far her kindness would have carried her; she came in that moment, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted this Scene of Tenderness. The <hi>Bassa</hi> reproached her secretly for this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable Intrusion: He was forc'd to go away after bidding <hi>Homais</hi> have a good Faith in the Charm, and not to look in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:151309:10"/> it till the time was expired that he had prescribed her.</p>
               <p>Whether it were her Opinion of the Charm, or that she had not been at all ill, she drest her the following day to go to their Devotion at the Mosque in all the exactness imaginable, and in the same colour'd Ribbons as the <hi>Bassa</hi> had wore the preceding day; but before she went, she remembred her to look into the Charm, for the time was already expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but what was her surprize, when she found in it a very fine Ruby-Ring, with these words in the Paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Ruby does not alone bring the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of my Passion, but it has Charms capable to inspire</hi> Homais, <hi>having been thus worn by her with the same Sentiments; nor can she refuse coming at six a Clock to the Palace Garden, unless she will render the Charm of no effect, and procure the death of the Slave that conjures her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was the Custom of the <hi>Bassa,</hi> with the other People of Quality, to go once every day to the <hi>Mosque,</hi> where he did not fail to render himself as usual to observe the Reception that <hi>Homais</hi> would give
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:151309:11"/> him after the Declaration. As for what concern'd her, she very well knew he was to be there, and putting the Ring upon her Finger, she tore the Paper into small pieces, and put them in her Pocket, which in passing by the <hi>Bassa</hi> she scatter'd at his Feet, pretending to draw out her Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and pass'd on unconcernedly to the place she was to kneel at. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, she did not fail during the Devotion to pull off her Glove, and let the <hi>Bassa</hi> see that she had the Ruby upon her Finger. He knew not what construction to draw from all this; he believed that she shew'd it to him only to express the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire she had of restoring it to him, and that she would take the first Opportunity to do it, but that was too publick a place to entertain her in, unless he had been in a condition of appearing her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which the <hi>Sultaness</hi> his Wife, being of an Illustrious Blood, would never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to, and by consequence he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to depart unsatisfied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Homais</hi> came according to the conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the <hi>Palace Garden;</hi> but the <hi>Bassa,</hi> who was nettled at the Affront she had given him, and who could not believe that after such an Action, she would come
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:151309:11"/> to a meeting with him, did not go. She resented this as a Mortal Crime, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to repent, that she had given her Heart to him: She had already waited an hour, and began to impatient her self, when a young <hi>Lord,</hi> that had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served her, and pass'd several times by her, came near to satisfie his Curiosity, and see if he could prevail with her to unmask. She did not know him, and thought that nothing could be better imagined than he was; they had an equal desire to learn who each other were, so that it was not difficult for that <hi>Lord</hi> to enter into a Discourse with her. If it were possible for me, <hi>Madam,</hi> said he to her (after a long conversation) to give my Heart to a Person that I have not the Honour to know, and who will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose confidence enough in me to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her self. I should offer mine to you, but you will not be angry, if I declare to you, I cannot be conquer'd by any thing but fair Eyes, and that my Heart is proof against all other Attractions. You do not know, <hi>Madam,</hi> to what a degree you may enslave me by that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, there wants nothing but that for an absolute Conquest. If the Conquest
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:151309:12"/> (reply'd the disguised <hi>Princess,</hi> who was of a Humour to divert her self in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and to whom that conversation was very pleasing, in that it flatter'd her Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and was agreeable to her Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, because it gave her the prospect of a new Lover, younger and better made in her Eyes than was the <hi>Bassa,</hi> who was an older Acquaintance, and had just the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

At these words she went away: The gentile Air, which was inseparable from her, her Wit, and her manner of discoursing had made such an impression on him that they were spoken
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:151309:12"/> to, that he believed her, and did not send after to know who she was, relying on the promise she had made him of a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Acquaintance, and resolving with himself, that if she were of any Quality, he should easily retrieve her, because he thought it impossible but he should know her again in any Dress, tho' he had not seen her Face.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Homais</hi> was no sooner got home, but she enquired if she were sent after, and began to be angry at her new Lover for obeying her so unseasonably; however Love was on his side, and she did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him by the half so much as she did the <hi>Bassa;</hi> and being not able to contain for Rage, she went into her Closet, and writ him this Letter.</p>

               <p>She sent him this Letter by one of her <hi>Pages;</hi> he received it, and coldly told him, it required no Answer, and that he might tell his Lady so. Who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the Surprize, or rather the Rage of <hi>Homais?</hi> What can be the meaning of this, cry'd she to her self? Have I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd my self, and is this Beauty mean enough to be despised? Or does not the <hi>Bassa</hi> love me, and have I not given a wrong Interpretation to his Actions, and ascrib'd that to Love, as was only the effect of Gallantry? Perhaps the Ring that I flatter'd my self with, was given in Raillery; and I have exposed my self after an unpardonable manner; I have
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:151309:13"/> given him liberty to think what he will of my Conduct; and if he has any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable thoughts of it, it is more than he is obliged to have. I will write to him once more to ask his Pardon for my mistake, since he cannot but look upon me to be under very fantastical Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.

It must be more than indifferency that could work such a change in him; and there is some Mystery in it which I must learn.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> under the Character of a Passionate Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it is not to be doubted, but that he thought himself very happy. <hi>Homais</hi> seeing him approach, came to him, and touching his hand, said, You have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged me, my <hi>Lord,</hi> to be very importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with you; I have treated you as a Lover, but I am satisfied how much I was mistaken. Ah, for that, Madam, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted the <hi>Bassa,</hi> I was, and still de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to be consider'd as such; and it is not only my greatest Ambition, but my Happiness also. I confess that I have been in fault, and that I was to blame, to judge as I did by Appearances. I thought you would punish my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, and seeing you scatter the Charm so, I had little reason to expect you would come as you did to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the Palace, that was the cause of my not coming; if I had had the least hope of your being there, you would have had reason for an ill Opinion of me, if I had not flown to meet you; for there was nothing so much my inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As for your first Letter, if I had answer'd it in the same manner it was
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:151309:14"/> writ, I should have been constrain'd to have treated you with less Respect than I was willing to do; I did not think that I merited the name of Traytor from you, that of your Slave being an Epithet more proper for one that will never betray, tho' always adore you.</p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Bassa</hi> ventur'd, seeing that <hi>Homais</hi> was appeas'd, to press her in his Arms, and having several times kiss'd her fine Neck, he began to be very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate for greater favours. The trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you have given me to day, said she to him, does not deserve that you should be consider'd as a Lover: Why did not you endeavour to appease me, when you believed me dis-satisfied with you? but not a Letter, nor the least mark of the regret you express to have had, and which if it were real, would certainly have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd; but I have forgiven you, and, my dear, you are no longer in a possibility of displeasing me, do but love me for ever, and I care not what I endure.</p>
               <p>There are certain ways in Lovers whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inexpressible; such languishments, such sighs, such reciprocal regards, which are more comprehensive than the finest Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and more engaging, such as the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:151309:15"/>
                  <hi>Princess</hi> and the <hi>Bassa</hi> were employ'd in; he ventur'd to kiss her Lips, her Neck, to behold the beauty of her Breasts, to press her in his Arms, and to sigh upon her Bosom, whilst she assented by the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire in her Eyes to all that he did or said, and possibly had he had as much presumption as desire, he had made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self very happy; but believing he was advanced very far for the first time, and that he had but one step more to make, and that the next meeting would crown his expectations, he accepted of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyals she made him, and retired after a very long Conversation, but in certain hopes of being very happy the next time they met.</p>
               <p>In all appearance, <hi>Homais</hi> was very much in Love with a Man she could treat thus kindly, and to whom she could speak and act after such a tender manner; but Appearances are very deceitful, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Appearances drawn from the discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of People so unconstant as <hi>Homais.</hi> She found after he was gone, that it was not Love, but an Amorous inclination, that had rendred her so languid and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceless in the Arms of the <hi>Bassa;</hi> and she thought still of that new Lover she
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:151309:15"/> had seen in the Palace-Garden, whom she was resolved to be acquainted with, and she knew not whether she did not love him better than she did the <hi>Bassa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was several days before the <hi>Bassa</hi> had an Opportunity of discoursing the <hi>Princess;</hi> he saw her very often, but not in Private; it was a long time before he could bring her to a meeting, he sigh'd, he prest, but was still deny'd; she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested to him, that it was not want of Love in her, but some remains of Honour, which all her Passion for him could not vanquish; and that he ought to rest sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the possession of her Heart, which she gave him intirely; but as for the rest, it was what she would never grant to any but him that was destined to be her Husband. The <hi>Bassa,</hi> little sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with this, used all his Address to try if that could procure him any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. He repented for having so ill em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd those moments when he was last with her; he call'd her false, insensible, and ungrateful to the pain and the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion he had for her; became lean, scarce eat any thing at all. The Court obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this alteration in him; and in short, after she had made him languish a good
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:151309:16"/> space, she promised him another meeting for that Night in her Lodging, after her Father should be gone to Bed, and the Family retired.</p>
               <p>It is not to be askt if the <hi>Bassa</hi> flew with all imaginable haste to the Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous: He found her undrest, and in that Garb nothing could be more amiable; his Passion being heightned by all these Obstacles, he was the most impatient imaginable. I come to ask you for the last time, Madam, said he to her, if it is my Death you design, for in the denyals you make me, you shew me a more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Prospect than any the most cruel Torments could present. You know very well, my Lord, reply'd she with a languishing Air, that I love you, and there rests but one thing for me to do to convince you intirely of it, and put it out of dispute: You dispair too soon; and why may not you hope that you may Conquer my Person, since you have still the same Charms that subdu'd my Heart? I do not love you less, since I confess'd to you, that nothing was so dear to me as you. She accompanied these words with a thousand tendernesses. The <hi>Bassa</hi> held her in his Arms, and believed he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:151309:16"/> had now found the time, and was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to pursue the Occasion. Her Eyes were languishing, her Soul softned with his Passion; and in a word, she was often upon the very point of yielding, tho' no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is harder to overcome than the last pangs of Modesty and Honour. <hi>Osman</hi> used his utmost Address to vanquish all the scruples she had remaining, and to conquer the feeble resistance she shew'd; but whether it were a return of Vertue, tho' one would believe she had but little; or that she did not love him so much as she imagin'd, for very often we deceive our selves in this point, and fancy our selves more in Love than really we are, she started from that languishing state, and told him, that she would yield, but not then, and that he ought to rest satisfied with her Promise. <hi>Osman</hi> could not bear so cruel a disappointment without despair. You treat me cruelly, Madam, said he to her; and since you resolve my Happiness, is it not the same thing to day as to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and perhaps you will not then have more disposition than now? I promise you, reply'd she, that I will be more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable. But when, interrupted the <hi>Bassa?</hi> Shall I render my self here at the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:151309:17"/> same hour to morrow? and will you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise me to make me happy? I consent to what you propose, return'd she, and I'le keep my word with you: You know I love you, and that it is not in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to deny you any thing. She left him at these words, and he expected the hour with impatiency; he slept not at all that Night, and on the morrow he was told, that a <hi>Page</hi> from <hi>Homais</hi> ask'd to speak with him; he was presently introduced, and deliver'd the <hi>Bassa</hi> a Letter from his <hi>Lady,</hi> which was this.</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:151309:17"/> a disappointment which could not be equalled; he upbraided her, call'd her inconstant, despised her want of Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; and in a word, resolved to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue her no more, since she was too change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be taken: But when he consider'd how lovely she was, and those tender moments he had past with her when she lay in his Arms in a manner unguarded, he repented him that he had employ'd them so ill; but since Time is not to be recall'd when it is once past and gone, and since he was sensible of this; he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to bring her to another meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where he was resolved she should not escape him. To effect this, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the way that he was sure would take with her; he knew well her Temper, and that she would do any thing rather than lose a Lover, he therefore resolved to frighten her into complyance, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly answer'd her Letter with this little Billet.</p>

                  <hi>Homais</hi> did nothing but laugh at this Adventure, to see the Credulity of the <hi>Bassa,</hi> and how he turn'd it all upon Love: She was in a negligent undress, which she put on to make her look more languishing; and in that she thought to please both <hi>Osman</hi> out of sympathy, and <hi>Ismael</hi> out of the thoughts that she was become so for the love of him: But the truth of all was, because it became her best; she did not forget to put on the Scarf she had first seen this latter in, and which she had not worn since: And at the usual hour for visiting, she went to wait upon the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> who was in the <hi>Bassa</hi>'s Chamber, where they brought <hi>Homais: Osman</hi> was lying upon a Bed; he looked very pale with his late Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: <hi>Ismael</hi> was sitting by, who appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a thousand times handsomer; than ever; <hi>Homais</hi> gazed incessantly upon him, which she pretended to the <hi>Bassa</hi> was out of discretion, that so she might give the <hi>Sultaness</hi> no umbrage. <hi>Osman</hi> was not satisfied with this; he pursued her with
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:151309:23"/> his Eyes, and very often surprized hers in the pleasure they took to look upon <hi>Ismael:</hi> She perceived how uneasie he was, and therefore rose up to be gone: At the motion she made, her Scarf, which she had purposely loosned, fell down; <hi>Ismael</hi> took it up, and would have resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to her: She let it remain in his hands some minutes, and smiling, said aloud to him, That he deserved to wear it for the pains he had taken: I believe you are not enough in favour, my <hi>Lord,</hi> with any of the Ladies of our Court, to receive such Presents from them as yet; and therefore I am resolved to be the first that shall make you any of this nature; and the <hi>Sultaness</hi> shall, if she please, tie it on. At this the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> who could not refuse the Office, set her self to do it; the <hi>Bassa</hi> was greedily looking on, and <hi>Homais</hi> turning to him, said, Do you not see, my Lord, what I do to employ your Wife, that so I may gain one moment of time with you? And is that all the Design you have in it? returned the <hi>Bassa</hi> coldly. Yes, replied she; for what other can there be?

I shall quickly be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to health, Madam, interrupted he, if you continue your Goodness and your Promise to me. Endeavour you Health first, replied she, and we will talk further of that. She pitied him to see him look so ill; and yet still to talk to her in that manner, she thought his Head ran too much upon Love, for one so pale, so sick, and so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered as he was; and therefore she would say no more to him, not considering that she was the cruel Cause of his illness, for which she had no sort of remorse.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sultaness</hi> had finish'd her Work, and <hi>Ismael,</hi> who by this time perfectly knew the Scarf, came with so good a Grace, and with so much Joy, to thank <hi>Homais</hi> for the favour that she had done him, that she answered him with a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing air, That it was his fault; if he had not greater Advantages. She could say no more, because the Eyes of the <hi>Bassa</hi> were incessantly upon him, and she went away some moments after.</p>
               <p>As soon as the <hi>Bassa</hi> found himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone with <hi>Ismael,</hi> whom he was despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:151309:24"/> jealous of, notwithstanding all that <hi>Homais</hi> had said to convince him of the contrary, he resolved to frighten him from returning her any favourable appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances: You are doubless, my Lord, said the <hi>Bassa</hi> to him, seeing him look upon that fine Scarf that had been given him, decoy'd with that mark of Favour from <hi>Homais;</hi> but deceive not your self too much, she often makes Presents of that nature, and not always neither with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; I forbid you to entertain any upon her; you know what you owe me, and what occasion you will have for me: If you would not have me abandon you, you must resolve to obey me; I cannot believe you, Cousin, so blind as to yield upon bare appearances; <hi>Homais</hi> is of an Illustrious Blood, she will never have the Consent of her Father for your Alliance, and therefore I would counsel you betimes to avoid the snare that is set for you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ismael</hi> protested to the <hi>Bassa,</hi> that he had no thoughts but of obeying him; and that besides, he did not think <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais</hi> to be that Beauty as other People esteemed her. This satisfied the jealous <hi>Bassa,</hi> who did not believe his Cousin yet so much in Love, as to dissemble with him.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:151309:24"/>
               <p>But <hi>Ismael</hi> easily saw the Motive that induced the <hi>Bassa</hi> to speak as he did, and therefore did not think himself obliged to tell him the truth of things: He saw the inclination <hi>Homais</hi> had to love him, and she was too fine a Woman not to make one wish to improve it to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Advantage. He consider'd, that in marrying her, he should more advance his Fortune, than in any thing the <hi>Bassa</hi> could do for him, and was therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to make use of it now, when it appeared so favourable; and began from that very moment to entertain a design upon her; therefore taking leave of the <hi>Bassa</hi> soon after, he went to his own Lodging, where he writ her this Letter.</p>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:151309:26"/> in a languishing manner by her, and after two or three moments of silence, he said thus to her: Since you flatter me so much, Madam, in the Opinion of your Love, and that I enjoy at this moment the greatest of favours from you, give me at least leave to hope, that you will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny me the proofs I demand of you; and that you will permit me — All is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted you, interrupted she; but is this a time to believe any thing can be refused you? or where is the necessity for asking for what you may take? is it to redouble my shame, and make me more sensible of the injury I do my Honour? Ah, for that, Madam, reply'd he hastily, you need not to have any fear that I would violate it; I were unworthy then indeed of the Honour you do me, I will be the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server of it; and since I love you in so sacred a manner, you need not to have any apprehensions: I would make you my Wife, and it is to that inestimable Happiness I aspire; if you love me, as you pretend, you cannot refuse it me, nor ought you to have any regret, for admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me thus alone by Night, when I shall have had the Honour to Marry you— Ah, interrupted the deceived <hi>Homais,</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:151309:26"/> where is the occasion for all this? and cannot we love without marrying? At these words she took the Hand of her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and laying it upon her Breast, taught him by that Action, and by what she had said, that it was a much easier thing than he imagined it; if his surprize were great, his joy was not less, though perhaps he had rather have advantaged his Fortune, than have gratified his Passion; but who could resist so strong a Temptation? They must have had very little of the Lover, to have been able to have done it. <hi>Ismael</hi> had a quite contrary Opinion of her before; for when he believed her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely vertuous, he would have thought it his greatest Happiness to have marry'd her; now he rendred thanks to his good <hi>Angel,</hi> for delivering him from so appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent a danger, and past the Night with her doubly satisfied.</p>
               <p>You see in what a posture the Affairs of the <hi>Bassa</hi> were in; he had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised the first Embrace, and is hardly now in a possibility of having the second; he that had loved her with so perfect a resignation, and to whom she had made so tender returns; he, I say, to have the Reward of all his Services given to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:151309:27"/> that she had never seen before, is a sufficient example of her inconstancy; and after which injustice, we cannot won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at any thing she does.</p>
               <p>The following day she drest her self to appear at a splendid Collation her Father gave to the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Libardian,</hi> who was come from <hi>Colchis,</hi> for the good of his own Affairs, and resolved to make some short stay at Court: He was a <hi>Prince</hi> in the declension of his Age, but his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation was sweet and ingenuous; his Soul was amorous, and he still retain'd that part of his Youth; he had a passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate inclination for the Service of the fair Sex, and knew admirably well to make his Court, so that he was ever well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as well for his Merits, as Quality; in short, what occasion is there for us to speak farther of his Person? He came to the Entertainment, and was presently charm'd with the Beautiful <hi>Homais:</hi> The first impressions she made upon his Heart, was too strong, ever to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> efaced; never was so sudden and so entire a Conquest; he had not seen her since her being a Woman, for that the Regency of <hi>Colchis</hi> obliged his absence from his own Court, <hi>Homais</hi> quickly perceived the Effects her
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:151309:27"/> Beauty had wrought on the Heart of her Soveraign; she affected a sort of sensibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity her self, to engage him the more; she hearkned with attention to all that he said, and gave it its due commendation: Praises from the mouth of a Person we love, are ever well received; the <hi>Prince</hi> flatter'd himself from thence, that he was not indifferent to her; and she, who had found in him what would gratifie her Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, was resolved to Marry without Loving, and accordingly treated him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter such a manner, as perswaded him her inclinations were as strong for him, as his were violent for her; this, in lieu of disgusting, the more inflamed him; for there is nothing works so much upon Old People, as this Opinion; it makes them vain and fantastick; they think it not impossible for them to create Love in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; they believe any thing, rather than that they are Old, and are easily flatter'd into an Opinion of what they desire; they trust all appearances, though never so ridiculous, provided it hits the wishes of their Souls, and are most accessary to their own deceiving.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Homais,</hi> who was not ignorant of this, pleased her self to see the effects of her
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:151309:28"/> Dissimulation, and how greedily the <hi>Prince</hi> received the Poison of her Praises: The most ingenuous are often the soonest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, when they meet with those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons they would be lov'd by; and their own Hearts being exempt from Flattery, they believe all the World as sincere as themselves, especially when there is no appearance of Interest they can have in it.</p>
               <p>We are not to wonder then, that the <hi>Prince,</hi> who was himself an honest Man, suspected no deceit in <hi>Homais:</hi> He enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd her presently with his Love, which she received with a feigned Modesty, which is the truest way to create a good Opinion in those we would enslave. She appear'd very reserv'd, but her Eyes, which she did not much manage to the contrary, went into their usual languishment, which perswaded the <hi>Prince,</hi> who carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served them, that she was not insensible: He allow'd a great deal to her Youth and Modesty, and to spare her the confusion, he believed himself lov'd by her, without her telling him so.</p>
               <p>A Lover so commodious, who inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets every thing to his own Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, was the properest for <hi>Homais,</hi> in

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:151309:29"/> was, he appearing pale, but had however a great deal of joy diffused over his face. He threw himself on his knees by the <hi>bed,</hi> where she was lying in expectation of <hi>Ismael</hi>'s coming: He kiss'd her fair hand, which she gave to raise him from the ground, and in all probability he had there been very happy, if possession of her we love can make us so, when the <hi>Woman</hi> that was of her Confidence came to give her notice that her Father was coming, and would in two minutes be there. When our Destiny is capricious, 'tis in vain that we expect to be happy. The unfortunate <hi>Bassa,</hi> more dead than alive at this most cruel disappointment, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to suffer himself to behid; he would go into the Dressing-room, but <hi>Homais</hi> told him, That it would be too near; that her Father might perhaps take the fancy to go in; and that he came not there at that hour for nothing; and that he must resolve to enter a Closet at the further end of the Dressing-Room: They had no time to lose, she thrust him in with a great deal of precipitation; and locking the door, took the key in her pocket, and went again to the <hi>Bed-Chamber,</hi> where she found that it was <hi>Ismael,</hi> and not her
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:151309:30"/> Father, that had alarm'd her so: She had suspected the truth of this before, and laughed to her self at the design of the poor <hi>Bassa,</hi> who whilst she held him lock'd up in that restraint, suffered the most sensible of Injuries from her, in that she bestowed her favours upon a young <hi>Rival,</hi> who had no other advantage over him, but that of a shorter acquaintance with this fickle <hi>Princess:</hi> He told her, That as soon as he had received her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he flew with all possible haste to obey her Commands. The Conversation was very tender, and lasted a good space; the <hi>Bassa,</hi> began to be very impatient; he heard a Man's voice, but believing it was her Father's, he durst not make the least noise. <hi>Homais</hi> would punish him once for all, and was resolved to detain him there yet longer, when her Woman came running in, to tell her that of a truth her Father, with the Prince of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardian,</hi> was come of her side, and would be immediately with her. This confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her, she was disordered beyond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; she knew not what to do with <hi>Ismael,</hi> she consulted him and her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and presently resolved to put him into the Dressing-Room, for that there
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:151309:30"/> was no other place: She remembred that she had the <hi>Bassa</hi> lock'd up, and that he could not come out, if he should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour it; which she doubted not but he would do, if he suspected there was another in the outer-Room; she gave it to <hi>Ismael</hi> in charge, that he should not make the least noise, nor remove from the place where she put him; that be-besides her <hi>Father,</hi> she had other appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions, which she would tell him when time served; that it concerned her Life, he should exactly obey her; and that if he did not, it might be fatal to all: She recommended him to the care of the <hi>Gods,</hi> and had not a long time been so devout as then. By the time she was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to her <hi>Chamber,</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> with her Father was entred in; they told her that the reason of their coming at that late hour, was to acquaint her with the News which had been brought the <hi>Prince,</hi> of an Incursion the <hi>Abcas</hi> had made into the Kingdom of <hi>Colchis:</hi> They have broke the Truce, Madam, said the <hi>Prince</hi> to her, which we had taken with them; and it is necessary that I instantly depart to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish their Faithlesness; but, Madam, it is death for me to leave you; in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:151309:31"/> of my Happiness; the <hi>Prince</hi> your Father has made me hope, that you will not refuse your Consent to my Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and nothing of less consequence than the preservation of my Life, should have brought me here, at an hour very unfit to visit Persons of your Rank and Merit. Here <hi>Homais</hi> declined her Eyes, being in an uncertainty what to say, and dreading of all things that she should be discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when her Father in a few words told her, That the <hi>Prince</hi> was so much taken with her, as to resolve upon a Marriage with her, for the following day, because he was to depart within two; and strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded her to receive the Honour, with that resignation as became her. It is I that am to esteem it my Glory, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the <hi>Prince;</hi> but passionate as I am, I shall refuse it, unless the beautiful <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais</hi> agree without reluctancy; it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I should die, than affront her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. My Lord, interrupted she, I have too much Obedience for my Soveraign, and too much Admiration for his rare Qualities, to deny my Heart to merit so irresistibly: I yield, Prince of <hi>Libardian,</hi> pursued she, in giving him her hand, and believe that the Duty I owe a Parent, is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:151309:31"/> the least inducement to this Condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I receive this Happiness, answered the <hi>Prince</hi> (in kissing her fair hand) with all the Transports that can proceed from Adorations so sincere as mine: And when I repay with Baseness or Infidelity the Favour, I give you leave to destroy that Life, over which I give you an absolute disposal. After they had thus resolved upon the Wedding the following day, the <hi>Prince</hi> with her Father retired, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to incommode <hi>Homais</hi> by a longer stay at so unusual an hour.</p>
               <p>But it is time to return to the <hi>Bassa,</hi> whom we left in the Closet of <hi>Homais:</hi> How did he accuse Heaven and his hard Fate, for taking him from the Arms of that charming Woman! He remain'd in that cruel constraint some moments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other use of Reason; and all his Sense was employ'd in reproaching his irreconcilable Stars; at length his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments gave place to his Curiosity, and the desire he had of rejoining those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations which had been so cruelly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted; he listned attentively to hear if the Person was gone, whom he mistook for the Father of <hi>Homais,</hi> and heard sighs which could not proceed from any but
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:151309:32"/> passionate Lovers, whom he judged to be engaged in a Conversation too amorous for his Repose or Honour: An, now is this cry'd he: Has this fickle Person thus abused us? we must ruine this fortunate Rival, and undo her. As he was in these thoughts, he heard the door of the Dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing-Room open, with all that had been said to <hi>Ismael;</hi> and <hi>Homais</hi> was no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner returned to her Chamber, but he softly opened the door of the Cabinet, which went with a spring, and was more than <hi>Homais</hi> remembred; and calling to <hi>Ismael</hi> in a low voice, Here, here, my Lord, come in here, or <hi>Homais</hi> may want room for a third. Never was any Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize comparable to <hi>Ismael</hi>'s; he heard his Cousin's voice, which he perfectly knew; and coming to him into the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, which the <hi>Bassa</hi> shut upon him, Is it possible, my Lord <hi>Osman Bassa,</hi> that I should find you in the Closet of <hi>Homais?</hi> and is this then the result of that good Advice you gave me? I see well the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest you took in it. It is very true, my Lord, replied the <hi>Bassa,</hi> and you are not mistaken: I have had some concern for <hi>Homais,</hi> and should have made no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to have owned it to you, upon your least
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:151309:32"/> distrust; but this renders you more cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, and you should have took the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning I gave you. An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> what, would you have had me, replied <hi>Ismael,</hi> return'd with cruelty and disdain those Advances that were made? No, my Lord <hi>Bassa,</hi> that is not like a gallant Man; though perhaps had I known how faithless she is, I should have taken another manner of Conduct. We have both, answered <hi>Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> too much Honour to be imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and we must both abandon her; she is not worth our Anger, neither shall she be the occasion of a Quarrel between us. Here he imbraced <hi>Ismael,</hi> and gave him a short account of his Engagement with <hi>Homais;</hi> and <hi>Ismael</hi> repaid his Civility, by the confession of his; after which, they both resolved never again to speak to her. The <hi>Bassa</hi> was irreconcilably di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied with her, as having the greatest reason to be so, and therefore renounced her without reluctancy; but <hi>Ismael,</hi> who had been well treated by her, found that his Obedience to the <hi>Bassa,</hi> had as great a share in the business, as his Honour could have, though he loved no more than others, to be cajoal'd with, in such an imposing manner.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:151309:33"/>
               <p>As soon as the Prince of <hi>Libardian</hi> was departed, <hi>Homais</hi> came into the Dressing-Room, with a design to send away <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael,</hi> and release the <hi>Bassa;</hi> but what was her surprize, when opening the door, she found not her Lover, nor any other, though she had not much time to reflect? for the Closet being open'd by the <hi>Bassa,</hi> he came out of it, followed by <hi>Ismael,</hi> who only saluting <hi>Homais</hi> with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found respect, went out of the Chamber, and out of her Lodging, without her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the freedom of spirit to speak to them.</p>
               <p>But at length having recovered her sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize by a happy presence of mind, which Nature had blest her with; she ran after them, intending to recall the <hi>Bassa,</hi> but it was too late, he was gone, and she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in a desperate rage: Ah! cry'd she, be not these the Actions of Traytors, to combine thus together to destroy my repose? Then she reflected with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour on that Adventure; and fearing it should make a noise, and prevent her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the <hi>Prince,</hi> she resolved to write to the <hi>Bassa,</hi> whom she loved best, in this disposition of her Soul, because she had most injur'd him; and she doubted
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:151309:33"/> not but to recall him, since she had her Heart to reward his return; nay, she in that moment resolved to sacrifice to him all her Kindnesses for <hi>Ismael,</hi> who she had satisfied her Curiosity with, and therefore intended to abandon. She much feared the Spirit of <hi>Osman,</hi> who had been ill treated, and therefore resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to imploy all her Arts, to make him return to her, believing it the only way to hinder him from talking.</p>
               <p>But with these Resolutions, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for her to sleep that night; she passed it in a thousand inquietudes, and resolved to write to him as soon as he should be awake: She forgot it was to be her Wedding-day; and when it was morning, she arose, but was prevented from sending her Letter, by this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one, which she read not without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity.</p>

It was more easie for <hi>Ismael</hi> to resolve of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had not been so long in love; and his Passion being only the effect of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, it slackned when he was convinced that he was not the only beloved; besides he had no further expectations, which made him less ardent; for nothing so much takes off from a violent Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the acquisition of Desire. On the other side, the <hi>Bassa</hi> had been in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:151309:34"/> apprehension, and still deceived, which at length tired him, and made him less sollicitous of the Lover: He could have wished for his revenge; but there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no time nor possibility to effect it, he must resolve to think no more of her, but to consider her only as one that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited not the being beloved. He had not been long come home, when he was sent for by the Prince; and being such a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as I have described him; it was no wonder that he was honour'd with the esteem of all. The Prince of <hi>Libardian,</hi> who knew his Courage and Experience, created him Prime <hi>Visier</hi> of <hi>Colchis,</hi> and made him General under him of that Army, which he intended should march against the <hi>Abcas,</hi> with immediate Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to go to the Castle of <hi>Rucs,</hi> where <hi>Leron</hi> then resided, to receive his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and to get all things in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness against his return to <hi>Colchis,</hi> which should be in two days. The new <hi>Visier</hi> found this Imployment very agreeable to his Inclinations; it was much for his Honour, and would oblige his absence from the faithless <hi>Homais. Ismael</hi> saw the occasion too glorious not to embrace it; he told the <hi>Visier</hi> that he would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:151309:35"/> him, and share with him the danger of the War, as well as he had done the Favour of <hi>Homais.</hi> They were presently to depart; and before they went, writ that Letter which was last inserted: The <hi>Visier,</hi> who well knew her temper, was affraid it would more afflict her than all the Reproaches that could be made her; he was not deceived in his Opinion, for it more perplexed the Soul of that haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Princess, than the most outragious Exclamations could have done, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the indifferency it was writ with: She tore it into a million of pieces at the reading; she fancied that she had most reason to complain: The Traytors, cries she, (all transported with Rage) never loved me, and I detest them both▪ and upon both shall my revenge be fatal: The Prince whom I am going to espouse, will, I am certain, remit his Power to me, and I will punish as I see occasion. In this resolution, she suffered her self to be dressed to all the advantage imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; and her temper being naturally gay, she had not much to do to appear so on this occasion, though her Heart was however deeply affected. The Prince came, and the Marriage was celebrated
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:151309:35"/> with all the pomp of the Country; it pleased the Vanity of the new Princess, to see the Court that was made to her; her Melancholy gave place to it, and she never appear'd in better-humour: The Prince was ravish'd with his good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and believ'd himself the most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of all Men. <hi>Homais</hi> wanted not Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress to improve the advantagious Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents he had of her: Never was there any thing seen more Glorious than that Ceremony, nor any thing more Beautiful than <hi>Homais:</hi> The Prince was more in Love than ever, and she had the pleasure to see her Ambition gratified, which ever was her most powerful Ascendant.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Visier was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Castle of <hi>Rucs,</hi> where being confirmed in his Ministry by the Prince of <hi>Colchis,</hi> he assembled the Forces, that since the late War had been quartered in several Camps throughout the Kingdom, and marched with them against the <hi>Abcas,</hi> leaving the Princes of <hi>Colchis</hi> and <hi>Libar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> to follow with the Main Body. His Orders were, not to meet those <hi>Abcas</hi> that had made an inroad into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but to fall himself into the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the <hi>Abcas,</hi> whilst the Princes fought
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:151309:36"/> their Army, which was, as we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, by a breach of Truce, entred <hi>Colchis.</hi> We shall pass over in a few words the particulars of this War, and only content our self with acquainting the Reader with the result thereof, which was highly advantageous to the Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Colchians.</hi> The Visier, according to his Orders, fell into the Country of the <hi>Abcas</hi> with his Army, and having easily vanquished what Forces he found upon the Borders, he marched uncontroulably far up into the heart of the Continent, burning and destroying all that was fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or habitable. The King of the <hi>Abcas,</hi> with the Prince his Son, was marching against him (as he understood) with a potent Army, which he knew himself not strong enough to encounter; therefore he resolved to retreat with his Forces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the two Princes, whom he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to joyn.</p>
               <p>Pursuant to this Resolution, he speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dis-encamped, and marched on his left Hand through the Country of the <hi>Abcas,</hi> being informed by his Spies, that the Princes of <hi>Colchis</hi> and <hi>Libardian</hi> had vanquished their Enemies; and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with repelling the remnant of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:151309:36"/> conquer'd Army, they were also entred the Country of the <hi>Abcas</hi> with great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility, which had obliged the King to alter the design he had of fighting the Visier, for that of meeting that more formidable Army, led on by two such Victorious and Renowned Princes. <hi>Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> being confident that the Intelligence was good, did not however alter the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign he had taken, but marched, as I said, on the left hand, with an intent to fall upon the Rear of the <hi>Abcan</hi> Army.</p>
               <p>Continuing his March, he entred a high Forrest, made very delightful by Nature and Art, which had embellish'd it with admirable Industry: There ran a clear Stream through it, and at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance on the other side he discovered a great many magnificent Pavilions, which he presently understood to be the Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a Beautiful Lady, whom he saw before him, abandon'd to all the rigour of War, her Guards having, upon the fight of the Visier's Army, basely fled from her defence into the adjoyning Mountains.</p>
               <p>As soon as he saw this beauteous Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, the Visier was himself the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished; she was surrounded with a Train
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:151309:37"/> of Thirty Ladies, who by a world of Tears bewailed their hard Fate, whilst she alone stood unmoved at the danger: She was habited in a slight Dress for the Field, branched with Gold, and clasped in some places with Diamonds: Her sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was of the tallest, and her shape a perfect symetry; but when we cast our Eyes upon her Face, it is impossible to see so many Charms, without being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; her Hair of a shining black, with Eyes of the same colour, that sparkled with all the fire common to them; her Complexion not to be equall'd by any thing, but the Majesty of her Mien, which enough declared that she had not lost her Courage with her Liberty. She was Armed with a Poyniard, which the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses of the Blood usually wear when they are in the Field; and she having in vain exhorted those of her Guard, which were yet within hearing, to dye, rather than yield themselves to be Slaves; but seeing she could but ill prevail over Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons struck with a panick fear, she drew her Poyniard, to prevent the Insolence of any that should be wanting in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to her. The Visier being not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of her design, beheld her with
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:151309:37"/> infinite Admiration, and would perswade his Heart, that the Princess of <hi>Libardian</hi> was not comparable, in point of Beauty, to this unknown Lady, approached her with fear enough, and saluting her after the manner of the <hi>Colchians,</hi> I know not, Madam, (said he, in letting fall the point of his Sword) what it is you see in us rude enough to give you so much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension; the most barbarous would cease to do so, at a sight so beautiful; and you, of all the World, ought not to fear any violence, especially when, like now, you meet with a Person who has a Heart, such as a gallant man ought to have; you are capable of producing asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing effects in the most insensible; we all obey you, and your Authority is Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute in all places where the great Visier of <hi>Colchis</hi> shall Command: His Quarrel extends not to the <hi>Abcan</hi> Ladies; and it is enough that he conquer the Men, to dispute with Women is too much. My Courage, reply'd that charming fair, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leaves me; though another would be surprized, perhaps, at a turn of Fortune, insupportable; the distance being very great between a Prison and a Throne; the assurance you give me is not displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:151309:38"/> and you are better instructed, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to treat ill a Princess, and the Daughter of the King of <hi>Abca,</hi> who was diverting her self in this Forrest, with her Court, believing her self free from the dangers of the War, in a place remote enough from it, in our apprehension; another, perhaps, would not tell you thus much being your Prisoner, and the chance of War giving you right to use me as you please; but you are too generous to treat me as other than a Princess; I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready an esteem for you, I believe I am not deceived, and that you are what you appear to be.</p>
               <p>The Visier was so charmed with the Beauty of the Princess, that he remain'd without reply. She saw the effects of her Beauty, and viewing <hi>Osman</hi> with a fatal Tenderness, which her Heart could not resist, for the best made Man of the <hi>East;</hi> You are dumb, my Lord, renewed she; is it from the chief Visier of <hi>Colchis</hi> that I must have returns so silent? Must I go with you, and not be assured of the Care of my Conqueror? Too obliging Princess, reply'd the Visier, beginning to recover himself, the Reproach is just that you make, but durst I explain it to you,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:151309:38"/> it would be found not disadvantageous to a Beauty so miraculous; but, pursued he with a sigh, you do ill to call me your Conqueror; would to the Gods my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty were as certain; you have yours, Madam, intirely; and though I run the danger of my Princes Anger, what would not one do to oblige one so lovely as you? Command me to conduct you to the place you will retire, though, durst I add, I make my self by this separation, the most unhappy of all Men.</p>
               <p>The Princess, by a little blush that came into her Face; let him know, that she un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood him; she had never seen any that appear'd to her so handsom; she took her Eyes from him with difficulty, and a sigh, which forced it self from her Breast, let her know, that her Heart was more engaged than she thought it was; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, a sense of Glory would make her treat him as if she did not understand him. I know not (my Lord, said she with a serious air) if I may believe you in earnest, when you tell me, that I am free; my Liberty is a greater Present, than I am willing to receive of an Enemy to my Father and my Country; I am no other than your Prisoner, the King will
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:151309:39"/> not let me long be so; allow me only to send him an account of my being taken by you, and I assure my self you will not treat me ill.</p>
               <p>The Visier, as much in Love as he was, would not permit the Princess any longer to be a Prisoner; he conjur'd her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her Liberty from him, since her Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity being unknown to his Soldiers, there would be no talk made of it; he chose, as he said, to be deprived of his greatest Happiness, which was that of seeing her, rather than to incommode her. The Princess, by a fatal prepossession, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this Generosity of her Lover. It is against my self I speak, Madam, did he renew, when I desire you to accept your freedom; alas! how dear is it going to cost me? And since it is impossible for me to live and not adore you; I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prevent your disdain, by a death, which I design as a punishment to that presumptive Heart, which is not able to resist you: I speak to you as well for the first time, as the last; have the goodness to pardon me, I go to Death, which, perhaps, I shall receive from the King your Fathers Arm, as a Reward for that Love, which my Stars have created in me,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:151309:39"/> for the Princess his Daughter, and which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> know to be highly audacious: As he finish'd these words, he bowed, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting her Answer, and mounted his Horse, whilst the Princess returned to her Pavilion, conducted by her Guards, who were returned from the Mountains, by the permission of the Visier.</p>
               <p>The Princess was glad that he had not staid her Reply, which her Glory requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red should be a severe one; and she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to make him sensible of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption; but then on the other side, she fear'd her Heart, it would not have her angry at a Person so amiable, and to whom she had such powerful Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>She was several days in great despon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, the more she reflected on the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier, the greater was her Tenderness for him: How often did she call her Glory to her aid? But Love, that had so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly possess'd that Heart (before insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible) being once entred, would not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his Station: How often did she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim against her Weakness and his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, who without being a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Prince, had dared to make a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Love to her? he that was an
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:151309:40"/> Enemy to the King her Father, and who was then engaged in an actual War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and had ruin'd with Fire and Desolation a great part of his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories. But then, she would also reflect on what he had done for her, his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity, his reciprocal Passion; and in a word, all those fine Qualities, that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him so amiable: Alas, how weak was her Glory, to her Love! in treating him ill, she should ruine all her Repose, and though he was no Soveraign Prince, he was of Rank in the World, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd a thousand inimitable Vertues; when, I say, she was with some frailty, considering of all this, Ah! cry'd she out, what Treachery is this? How does my Inclination betray my Glory? I must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver suffer it to be conquer'd; and should my Weakness augment, how would my Reputation be blasted? and into what irreparable inconveniencies would they not lead me? But how hard is it to avoid ones Destiny? And by a turn of Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I foresee this Passion will ruine me, it has already undone my Peace; and though it is in vain to contend with a Fate so determinate, we may hide our weakness, that is yet in our power to do,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:151309:40"/> and by endeavouring to treat the Visier <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll, we may at length come to do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reluctancy. But ah! renewed she a moment after, my Destiny has taken care of me, I need not fear a Person that I shall never see any more: Is he not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned already to <hi>Colchis?</hi> Is he not far from me, and beyond the power of any more perplexing my Heart with so much anxiety?</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Victorious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Colchis</hi> and <hi>Libardian,</hi> having sent their Orders to the Visier, to fall upon the Rear of the <hi>Abcas,</hi> presented the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel to that King, who had indeed a more numerous Army, because he had been well prepared before he broke the Truce, and designed the entire Conquest of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis,</hi> though his hopes had been defeated with his first Army, and made him stand only on the defensive part: It was within few hours of Night before he accepted the Battel, because he staid for the coming up of a considerable reinforcement of Horse led by the Prince his Son, a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant young Prince, and who behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with a Courage proportionate to his Birth: In a word, the Body being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd, they joyned Battel, and the Visier
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:151309:41"/> fell in upon the Rear, where he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely expected by the Prince of the <hi>Abcas,</hi> who knowing him to be near, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected his Design. There had not a long time been fought a Combat so bloody; Fortune would not decide the Palm, and the Night came on, just as the Victory began to incline to the <hi>Colchians;</hi> they were separated by the darkness, and the Retreat being sounded, the Visier came over, with the remainder of his Forces, to the two Princes, having been much wounded in the Fight, by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Combat he had had against the Prince of the <hi>Abcas,</hi> over whom he had some advantage.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Libardian,</hi> who lived not, in a divided state from his Charming Wife, grew impatient of that tedious War, and resolved to conclude it by a lasting Peace; and the day no sooner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, than in lieu of renewing the Fight, as he might very successfully have done, he sent to the King of the <hi>Abcas,</hi> to take a Truce for two Months, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Commissioners to meet from either side, upon the Frontiers, to agree upon the Articles of Peace; the principal one was, a Marriage between the Prince of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:151309:41"/>
                  <hi>Colchis</hi> and the Princess <hi>Bassima,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the King of the <hi>Abcas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Levan</hi> being extream Amorous, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not without repugnance, to this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, as not knowing any thing of the Beauty of her he was to Marry; but the Protector, who was a great Statesman, knew well the Advantage, and disposed the Prince of <hi>Colchis</hi> to obey him. The Picture of <hi>Bassima</hi> being brought to <hi>Levan</hi> one day, during the Negotiation, he found in it so many Charms, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be in Love with the Original; he shew'd it to all his Court, and having particularly asked the Opinion of <hi>Osman,</hi> whom he knew could judge of Beauty; but that Minister had no sooner cast his Eyes upon it, but he grew pale with sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, seeing it to be no other than that Princess whom he adored, and whom he had encountred in the Forest. <hi>Levan</hi> observing the disorder of his Visier ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied him for too much sensibility of heart, that would not let him, without surprize, see the Picture of a handsom Woman, who, perhaps, fell very short of what the Painter had made her; but to put that Minister quite in despair, he told him, that she was within a few days to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:151309:42"/> be his Wife; and that it was him, as his first Minister and Favourite, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to honour with the Character of Proxy, and that he should prepare his Equipage, to go within a few days to the King of <hi>Abcas</hi> Court, to Espouse the Princess <hi>Bassima,</hi> whom he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready impatient to see. <hi>Osman</hi> reply'd with such an aukward air, to the favour of his Master, that <hi>Levan</hi> knew not what to interpret it to; but not believing he had been prepossessed, he made no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reflection upon it.</p>
               <p>Never was any Destiny more cruel than this! How often did the <hi>Visier</hi> lament his hard Fate? But after perplexing himself in vain, by a turn of thought, he found himself not so wretched as he had fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied; a Marriage with <hi>Levan,</hi> would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly bring <hi>Bassima</hi> to the <hi>Colchian</hi> Court, where he should have Opportunities to see and discourse her frequently, which was more than he durst ever hope, should she remain in <hi>Abca.</hi> He considered fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that should she assent (which was very improbable) to Espouse him, he was not in a possibility of accepting the Honour, because he was already married to a high-born <hi>Sultaness,</hi> the Sister of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:151309:42"/> the Prince of <hi>Libardian,</hi> who though none of the youngest, and a Woman he had never loved, yet it was by her Interest in the Protector, that he came to be first Minister of <hi>Colchis; Selima,</hi> for so was she call'd, loved the <hi>Visier</hi> with a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affection, and would have sooner died than quitted her Interest and Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to him, though the first Woman of the World should desire it of her.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Treaty for Peace went on; but it is not our Design to enter upon the Affairs of State, nor the Proposals that were offered; let it suffice, that in the end the Peace was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and the <hi>Visier</hi> named to Marry the Princess <hi>Bassima</hi> by Proxy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Osman</hi> prepared all things with a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificence suitable to his temper; most of the <hi>Colchian</hi> Nobility put themselves into his Train; and being the first Man after the Prince and the Protector, it added much to the Splendour of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy; <hi>Ismael</hi> accompanied him during all the War, and would not now forsake him; he was some time after married to the Lady of the greatest Quality and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in <hi>Abca,</hi> who had been taken with him in the Forest, where she attended
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:151309:43"/>
                  <hi>Bassima,</hi> as he did <hi>Osman;</hi> and in few. years he raised himself by the Favour of the Princess of <hi>Libardian,</hi> to to be the greatest Man in <hi>Colchis.</hi> The <hi>Visier</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided in him his new Inclinations for the <hi>Abcan</hi> Princess, and deplored to him his hard Fate, that was going to treat him with nothing but Misfortunes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Visier</hi> was met within a days Journey of the King's Pavillions (where he then resided) by the Prince of the <hi>Abcas,</hi> who embraced him with much esteem, after the trial he had had of his Valour in the late War; and the following day brought him to his Audience to the King, who received him suitably to his Rank and the Character he bore. After the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony was past, the Prince conducted <hi>Osman</hi> to a magnificent Pavillion, that had been prepared for him, where he left him to his repose, and went himself to inform the Princess <hi>Bassima</hi> of what had passed: With what incredible surprize did she not learn the Quality and Name of the Ambassadour of <hi>Colchis!</hi> She had heard long before of the Sacrifice they intended to make of her; and her Soul had suffered terrible Conflicts, in the thought that she must Marry into a place
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:151309:43"/> where she should be every day obliged to see the Person for whom she had a fatal Tenderness: But her Soul being as eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as her Vertue, she resolved never to suffer that Minister to entertain her with his Passion, which could not but be cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal; and carefully to conceal from him her own Weakness of Heart, she would submit to so fatal a Conjunction, though she saw there was little Happiness to be expected for her, by a Marriage with a Person so amorous and inconstant as <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van</hi> was given out in the World to be.</p>
               <p>She took therefore a resolution worthy her Glory and Verture; and whilst the <hi>Visier</hi> was in his Pavillion, distracted with fears and hopes that she would forgive or punish his presumption, he saw an Eunuch enter his Tent, which she had sent to him; who no sooner found himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone with the <hi>Visier,</hi> who had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out the Attendants, thn saluting him after the <hi>Abcan</hi> mode, My Lord <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier,</hi> said he to him, I am sent to you by the Princess <hi>Bassima,</hi> who is both offended and obliged by you; she owes you her Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, 'tis true, but she says that your Presumption has much taken off from her
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:151309:44"/> Acknowledgment; she is a Princess jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of her Glory, and refuses you Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, unless you bring with you Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments conformable to your Estate and hers; you are a great Minister, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ignorant but a perseverance would be ruinous for you, and very dangerous for both: You are not permitted to see her, unless you renounce a Passion, that she knows not from whence it took en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to declare it self; in a few days she will be authorized to command you, that which she now intreats: She is going to be your Soveraign, your Queen; she will have it in her power to ruine you; and though she be too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to expose even her Enemies, yet here her Glory is interessed, and she will be obliged to seek redress from the Prince her Husband, should you disobey. Not, my Lord, pursued the Eunuch, but she believes you sensible of your Duty, and gives you this Advice, as to a good Friend, she was once obliged to you for her Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and abhors Ingratitude, as much as she loves her Glory; she should he sorry to be wanting in acknowledgment; she is willing to forgive what is past, and to lose the remembrance of your Crime, if
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:151309:44"/> you are not your self wanting in your Obedience to her. What, that I shall cease to love her? replied the <hi>Visier;</hi> it is impossible, it is not in my power to do it; I am contented to live without Hope, but then she must allow me to adore her. Do you well consider, my Lord <hi>Visier,</hi> interrupted the Eunuch, what it is you say? how do you think this Discourse will sound in the Ears of a vertuous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess? I shall be sorry to make her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the difficulty you find in obeying her Commands; but I cannot dispense my self from being faithful to her Interest, and in pronouncing the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of your Banishment from all places that she shall honour with her presence. Ah, hold, interrupted the <hi>Visier,</hi> I assent to all that you have said; I will die, I will never see her more, but yet I must love her as long as I live; you wonder much at my Conduct, but I deserve your pity; I am upon the point of renouncing all my Hopes, my Happiness, but tell my Divine Princess she shall be obey'd; I will no more speak to her of my Passion, it shall not any longer offend her; but cruel as she is, I must love her still, it is not in my power to do other; and she
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:151309:45"/> ought to pardon, in an unfortunate Lover, a Passion which he is so little master of: Yes, you may tell her she shall be obey'd, at the price of all my Repose.</p>
               <p>The Princess found greal consolation in the Promise of the <hi>Visier;</hi> she prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed her self a very severe Conduct, and and was resolved to follow it.</p>
               <p>The next day, he came to pay her the Compliment of the Prince his Master; this Minister, notwithstanding his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, had something so different from the mein of an Ambassadour, that it was easie to see he would be properer to sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit an Affair of Love for himself, than another: What poison was it to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to find the Princess more beautiful than in the field! Her Dress was more regular, her Looks composed, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly nothing was ever seen so amiable; her Eyes were large and sweet, as well as sparkling; her Mouth was inimitable, her Teeth of an orient so white, that few e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual'd them. <hi>Osman</hi> was lost irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, and he owed to his good Fortune (that was assisting) the acquitting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with general applause, of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission his Prince had given him.</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:151309:45"/>
               <p>Some days after, the Nuptials were ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, with the pomp so essential to that Country in matter of Marriage; but it was with a mortal despair that the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier</hi> performed the Ceremony; the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess perceived it, and assisted with a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy suitable to the state of her Soul; she gave her hand indeed to the <hi>Visier,</hi> but, alas! it was for another; and all her Repose was offered by that cruel Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: <hi>Osman</hi> durst not explain to her his Thoughts; his Eyes were full of sorrow, and his Air dejected; they passed over the Entertainment without being sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of what was said to them: The <hi>Visier</hi> made it his business to observe the Princess, he found agreeable entertainment in her Melancholy; and in that temper of Mind it was that gave him most satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>The day appointed for their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Osman,</hi> who had not said any thing to the now Princess of <hi>Colchis</hi> since the Audience, so exactly had he observed her Orders, as not to speak even of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things, found her all alone in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, cut out of part of a Forest that join'd her Pavillion; her People being retired to a distance, she was entertaining her
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:151309:46"/> self with the thoughts of her misfortune; she believed none to be so unhappy as her self, and stood thus a good while leaning over a Balustrade that formed an ascent, into an open Arbor, when she heard a person sigh behind her; it was the <hi>Visier,</hi> who had not dared to interrupt her, and who had been there already half an hour: My Lord <hi>Visier,</hi> said the Princess to him, what is it you come to seek for here? To die Madam, replied he dejectedly; that would be undoubtedly a much happier state, for nothing can be so miserable as the Life I live. You think so, answered the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess; but it is so customary a thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our own Misfortunes greater than others, that I do not wonder you flatter your self in that point. Alas! Madam, renewed he sighing, I am so fully satisfied of my own unhappiness, that I have not the good fortune to doubt it; my Prince is my Rival, but what a difference in our Destinies! I must complain of my cruel Stars, that in failing to make me the least of Men, has made me the miserablest; either of the two extreams, and I had been blest, a Soveraign Prince, or a Slave; in this latter, I should at least have been exempted from a hapless Love; and your
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:151309:46"/> Majesty too well understands the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the first; it is that which my Prince is going to possess, and perhaps without valuing the Blessing as he ought to do. Take heed (my Lord) interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Princess, what it is you say; a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Conjunction has made his Interest mine; had I not a real esteem for you, I should not pardon you thus much; but take heed what you do, follow the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice I gave, and rely upon your own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. I shall obey you all my life, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Osman,</hi> and it shall not be my fault, if your Majesty finds occasion to complain of me; if I am sometimes criminal, when I cannot avoid being so, your Majesty must have some indulgence for involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Errours, and be so favourable as to believe I obey you, as far as is possible for me to do. The Prince of the <hi>Abcas</hi> broke up this Conversation, by coming to tell his fair Sister, that every thing was in order for her departure.</p>
               <p>The King, the Queen, and the whole Court, accompanied them a days Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; but the Prince left them not till they came upon the Frontiers, that the <hi>Visier</hi> found it impossible once to renew his Conversation with the Princess; and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:151309:47"/> not long after his departure, they were met by the Princes of <hi>Colchis</hi> and <hi>Libar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> and their Court.</p>
               <p>Never did any Prince appear so satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with his good Fortune, as <hi>Levan,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the sight of that amiable Princess; he embraced a thousand times the Protector for procuring him that Blessing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded profusely the amorous Minister for his safe Conduct of her into <hi>Colchis,</hi> where they were no sooner arrived, but the Prince would have the Marriage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Visier</hi> not able to see the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of his Prince, beg'd leave to retire some short time, to put his own Affairs in order; which being granted, he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Castle (notwithstanding all the Caresses of the Sultaness <hi>Selima,</hi> who used her endeavours to stay him) with a resolution not to return, till the Passion of the Prince began to cool, which he knew would not be long, in a person so amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and inconstant.</p>
               <p>Alas, how true did he Prophesie? <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van</hi> was a Prince not design'd by Love to persevere in so laudable a Passion; he became less affiduous after some time; he was pauled, and began to search after
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:151309:47"/> other fair Objects. Oh, what a grief was this to the fair Wise of this Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant? And how flattering was that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity she had promised her self? The <hi>Visier</hi>'s Retreat had left her no disturbance on that part; and till this ill-timed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy, she found more Happiness in her Marriage, than she could have hoped; but to those that have misfortunes for their Lot, all those traverses that are made to avoid them, are either ineffectual, or bring them sooner upon us; this was too plain, on this occasion; the Princess complain'd to her Husband, that his cares were not the same; and (in a word) brought him the sooner to know, that he no longer loved her as he had done, though she were much more beauteous than any thing he could ever love.</p>
               <p>That which the more confirmed him in his injustice to the Princess of <hi>Colchis,</hi> was an Adventure which happen'd to him some days after, and which I am going to relate.</p>
               <p>One Solemn day, that he was seeing some Fire-works play, and the Cannon in the Castle discharged, a Slave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> came upon the Rampire, and knowing <hi>Ismael</hi> amongst all the Train of Courtiers,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:151309:48"/> pull'd him by the Arm, and begg'd him, to present him to the Prince, for he had an Affair of Consequence to impart to him. <hi>Ismael</hi> enquired what it might be? But the Slave gave him many denials, and in the end, told him, that if he would not present him, he must desire the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of some other. <hi>Ismael</hi> believing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that it was of moment, came up to the Prince, having an easie access to him, and told him the whole story of the Slave: <hi>Levan</hi> caused him to called, and enquired of him the business: My Lord, reply'd (boldly) the Slave, the Affair is for your Cabinet, and you will believe me, when I assure your Majesty my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress is from the finest Woman of the World, that has for your Highness a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate inclination. The Prince imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately fired at this, yet not knowing whether the Advice were good, he paused some moments; but his Curiosity over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came all other Considerations, and telling the Slave, that he rely'd, in point of Beauty, upon no other judgment than his own; bid him come with <hi>Ismael</hi> at an hour he told him, to his Cabinet.</p>
               <p>The Prince had an impatiency, which could not be other than an ill Omen of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:151309:48"/> his approaching Misfortune, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore retired sooner, than People thought, to his Lodgings, where were already the Slave and <hi>Ismael</hi> attending his coming in his Cabinet; this latter withdrew, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Prince had not told him, that he might stay; and the Slave no sooner saw himself alone with the Prince, than kneeling, he presented him the Picture of a very fair Woman, set in Crystal, with this Letter.</p>

               <p>The Prince of <hi>Colchis</hi> read this Letter with surprize, and beheld the Divine Picture with admiration; he found there Beauties which presently seized his Heart, and drawing it to his Lips, he kissed it; Ah, cry'd he, what colour'd Hair is here! what Eyes! what a Mouth, and the Oval turn to the Face, which gives it an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible Air! Tell me (said he, turning to the Slave) tell me, I conjure thee, the Charming Original, who has already filled me with Love, upon the bare sight of her Picture, and the reading of her melting Billet, whose Chains is it I am to break: And is it possible that in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there can be found persons capable of giving trouble to this amiable Beauty? My Lord (reply'd the Slave) I am for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to tell your Highness what you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of me; and the fair person that sent me, will take it as a mark of your Passion for her, if you press me not to a discovery, which upon the assurance of your sensibility, she will make you her self: And your Majesty may well imagine she intends not to stop here, her Request at present is, the Honour of an Answer to her Letter, which I can assure your Highness, she impatiently expects. That
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:151309:49"/> I love her already, reply'd the Prince, is undeniable; therefore I will take the Reasons thou givest me, and obey this Charming Beauty.

               <p>He deliver'd this Billet to the Slave, giving him great promises of Liberty and Advancement, when he returned with the discovery of that Charming Person, which he impatiently longed to know. When the Slave was gone, the Prince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated the Picture, and found it so handsom, and the love of the Original so extraordinary, that he was not able to deny his Heart to so many Charms. Ah! cry'd he, how certain is it, that had I known you first, I should have anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted your Passion; and the danger of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment,

He said a great deal more to that fine Picture, and was so long entertaining his Curiosity, that <hi>Ismael,</hi> who waited without, and pretended to some confidence in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, because he introduced the Slave, came to the door of the Cabinet, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to know the Adventure, and hoping his Prince would call him in, which he was not mistaken in; for <hi>Levan</hi> hearing some tread, call'd, and <hi>Ismael</hi> having shewed himself, the Prince bid him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and being naturally not very secret in matter of Love, found this young Lord a very fit Confident, and related to him at large the whole story, giving him the Letter to read, and then shewing him the Picture, upon which he had no sooner cast his Eyes, but he knew it to be that of the Princess of <hi>Libardian.</hi> Ah, said he to himself, perfidious <hi>Homais!</hi> Then turning to the Prince, my Lord, said he, you will pardon my surprize, when I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint your Highness, that this fair per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, who is a thousand times fairer than

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:151309:52"/> Guard, pretending it out of State and Safety to her Royal Person, but in truth to confine her to the Castle, where, as I have said, she led a Melancholy Life, and a thousand times repented her self, of having married a Prince so capricious, and so jealous.

She lay in here of a Young Prince, who was named <hi>Alexander,</hi> and afterwards came to be Prince of <hi>Colchis.</hi> She had like to have died in her Labour, and the Prince of <hi>Libardian</hi> knew not till then that he loved her so much; he stirred not a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from her Bed-side, and often fainted with extremity of despair, when her Life was in danger. All these Testimonies of Affection, which would have softned any other Heart but hers, served but to give her more trouble, because she saw the greater was his Passion, the more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate would he be: At length she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and found her Beauty not at all
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:151309:52"/> impaired, the Prince her Husband thought it every day received new lustre, her shape was become more delicate; and, in a word, she never appeared with greater Beauty. When the Marriage was of the Prince of <hi>Colchis,</hi> she sollicited the Prince of <hi>Libardian,</hi> to let her come to Court, which he could not resolve upon, being alarm'd by the jealous <hi>Sultaness</hi> his Sister, who, upon the <hi>Visier</hi>'s retiring, assured him, it was only in order to see <hi>Homais:</hi> This made him that he confined her more closely, though he failed not by all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of good treatment, to gain her; but she fell into such a languishing fit of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and so much detestation of him, that she resolved to dye, rather than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in a Life so miserable. The Prince of <hi>Colchis</hi> had been represented to her, as the Prince in the World, the best made, and the most gallant. She began, upon these Reports, to entertain a great deal of Curiosity to see him; but that being impossible, she desired of the Prince her Husband, that he would send her the Pictures of the Prince and Princess of <hi>Colchis:</hi> He fail'd not to oblige her in this, not suspecting the fatal Consequence. She found the Princess too charming for

               <p>It was some hours in the Night, when, not yet weary of these Reflections, she saw the same Slave, that she had sent, enter her Chamber, follow'd by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, mufled in a Cloak, which he had no sooner thrown off, but she knew him to

Can you then have the goodness to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give my frailty, interrupted the Princess, and talking no more of what is passed, keep <hi>Levan</hi>'s secret and mine? I love him, <hi>Ismael,</hi> but it is only upon the sight of his Picture, and by sending him mine, I pretended to create in him a reciprocal passion. Your design has taken effect (Madam) reply'd <hi>Ismael,</hi> and our Prince this moment waits you in the Garden-House of the Castle.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:151309:55"/> easie ascent, the Turf being slid in many places for want of repair, because the Prince of <hi>Libardian</hi> feared not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded on that side, being upon the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Colchis. Ismael,</hi> after some time, ascended the Mud-wall, and easily leap'd down the Curtain, which reached the whole length of the Garden, bound with nothing but a Myrtle-hedge, because that part of the Castle was accounted sacred; and none of the Souldiers durst walk in that quarter, since <hi>Homais</hi> resided there: <hi>Ismael</hi> being thus happily got to the Gate of the Garden without discovery, knew well that the Prince of <hi>Libardian</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed at the Castle of <hi>Rucs,</hi> and that there was no danger of him; but just when he was going to leap the Hedge, a Centinel that kept watch near the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-gate, bid him stand; <hi>Ismael</hi> had his Sword drawn in his hand, and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier having no Fire-arms, he came bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly up to him and told him, That he must either resolve to die, or assist himself and the Prince in the design they had to enter the Garden: The Centinel well knowing <hi>Ismael,</hi> as having seen him at Court when it was his turn to be of the Prince of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardian</hi>'s Guard, readily assented to what
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:151309:55"/> he desired; the <hi>Bassa</hi> assured him of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and giving him some pieces of Gold, bid him go and enquire for a Slave he named to him, and which was the same that had brought the Message to <hi>Levan;</hi> the Souldier found it no great matter of difficulty to find him, and soon after brought him to <hi>Ismael;</hi> the <hi>Bassa</hi> in few words told him that the Prince wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without, and asked him how they should contrive his admittance?

It was not long before they found the Prince, who was wholly impatient; and being assured by

               <p>How impatiently did <hi>Levan</hi> expect the coming of that charming Princess, whose bare Picture had fill'd him with Love! and the praises <hi>Ismael</hi> gave him of her Sense, ravished him the more; he had not waited long, when the Slave came and set up twelve Wax-Tapers to enlighten the place: <hi>Levan</hi> saw there his own Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture crowned with Laurel, and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious over the <hi>Abcas;</hi> not far different from it, was that of <hi>Homais</hi> in great, upon which the Prince fixed his eyes with amorous regards, but he was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably diverted from that entertainment, by the sight of that charming Princess, who entred the Summer-house in a pompous undress, led by <hi>Ismael</hi> Bassa.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:151309:56"/>
               <p>The interview between two persons who had never seen each other, and yet were passionately in love, upon the fight of a Picture, must sure have something extraordinary. We confess it to you, Reader, that for our part we find it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to express to you the emotions of these two amiable persons, who were of so uncommon a make, as the most skilful Artist, let his flattery be never so gross, with all his agreeing Colours, would find natural Graces in them, not to be imitated by Art; and by consequence they were abundantly satisfied, that in each other there were Charms above feeble representations, and that they as much surpassed their Picture, as they did all other Beauties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Levan</hi> was of an extraordinary propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his Hair black, his Eyes large, and of the same colour; but there was in them so much fire, together with Regards amorous as his Soul, that it was hard for a Lady to resist their lustre; his Nose was well proportioned; and if he wanted any thing, it was a littie clearness in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, which was enough recompensed by a Majestick lofty Air, that was visible in his Countenance; his Lips were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:151309:57"/> colour'd than Vermillion; but above all, his Shape was so exact, as not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in his Kingdom but yielded him the advantage: We have already given you the Character of his Soul, without speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Sense, which was not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Princes, but equal'd the greatest pretenders to Wit, and he passionately loved People of that Character: He had often complained, that his Wife had little, or at least kept it from him by a severity in her Discourse, which he approved not of, and took as a certain sign of her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more Judgment and Wisdom, than that flashy Wit which (in his Opinion) made up all the Charms of Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: He also complained, that as she sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ill his <hi>Genius,</hi> her Complexion too well agreed with his to make him love her, being black as well as himself; and that he should have had much more kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for her, had she been either fair or brown. What then, Reader, dost thou think were the thoughts of this Prince (knowing his Opinion to be such) when he encountred with the beautiful <hi>Homais?</hi> who had in her Face and Temper, all that Nature could have framed to please the amorous Prince; certainly his Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:151309:57"/> is hard to be defined, and would be prejudiced, should we compare it to any other than what <hi>Homais</hi> resented, at the sight of a Prince so raised above other Men.</p>
               <p>He flew presently from the place where he was to meet her, and throwing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self at her knees, he embraced them with inconceivable ardour, his Soul being ready to expire with his sighs, and it was long before he could speak to her in any other Language; her Cheeks were redder than her Lips, with the shame of what she had done, and obliged her with a great Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief which she held in one hand, to cover her Blushes: Is it possible, Madam, cried the Prinee full of transport, that the Person of the World, the most amiable, should of her self call me to a Conquest, a thousand times more inestimable than the Crown I wear! I love you by Inclination as well as Gratitude; and my Heart can ill defend it self against such a Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Obligations: Where was I in those fatal Moments, when you were married to the Protector! Ah, cruel Prince! it is I only ought to possess a Wife so charming, because that there is not a Heart like mine so full of Love, to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:151309:58"/> make the returns to so great a Beauty, which it may justly claim. He said a great deal more to her on this occasion, and she answered him with an insinuation that really touched him; she conjur'd him not to interpret to a want of Vertue, that irresistible Inclination she found in her self to love him, to break her Chains, to bring her to Court, and to allow her some place in his Thoughts. He answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all this Discourse, with a Passion agreeable to what he felt; and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally inflamed, he assured her, That it was impossible for him to live from her; and the only Request he would make her, should be to preserve his Memory; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which happiness, he should be the most unfortunate Man in the World: They enlarged themselves a great deal farther on this; and being the two Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the World that had the most Wit, it was impossible they should resist each other: The Prince daring beyond all Men, pressed the fair <hi>Homais</hi> for greater Proofs of her Love; but she had a design to manage him better, and assured him he was never to expect nothing but her Heart; her Honour was something so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, as she would chuse to die, rather
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:151309:58"/> than betray it by her criminal Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But her Eyes so contradicted her Words, that they gave the Prince no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair, and he doubted not with a little better acquaintance to satisfie all her scruples. In a word, though it was the longest night of the year, day brake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could think of leaving her; the <hi>Bassa,</hi> who had been a Witness to the Conversation, conjured him to depart, telling him the People would be up in the Castle, and he could not possibly scape undiscovered: <hi>Levan</hi> sighed with regret, and before he would go, conjured <hi>Homais</hi> to send the same Slave with a Letter to him that day, that he might carry one back from him; he kissed a thousand times her fair Hand, and assured her that he would take order for her bringing to Court in a short time: The light of the Tapers gave place to the approaching day, before the <hi>Bassa</hi> could take him from her knees; and it is certain she did not much press him to retire; at length he departed, and having left the Castle with the same precaution he entred it, got on Horseback with <hi>Ismael</hi> Bassa; and all the way between that place and the Court, he entertain'd him with nothing but the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:151309:59"/> Beauty of <hi>Homais,</hi> in such a manner, as he knew very well that he was deeply tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with it.</p>
               <p>In the mean-while, the unfortunate <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier</hi> not able longer to live from his ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Princess, finding that solitude fed his Melancholy, and being call'd upon by the importance of his Charge, to return to Court, he came again to the Castle of <hi>Rues:</hi> The two Princes receiv'd him well, though <hi>Selima</hi> had given her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some distrust of him. The Princess of <hi>Colchis</hi> had a Melancholy incurable; the loss of her Husband's Affection, had reduced her to such a temper, that it the more estranged him from her; nor did the Thoughts of the <hi>Visier,</hi> which inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly crouded her Mind, less afflict and discompose her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Homais,</hi> the most satisfied Princess of the World, to see the good effects of her Design, fail'd not, in obedience to her Lover, to send him a Letter by that Slave, which was thus expressed.</p>

               <p>In the mean while, the impatiency he was in to bring her to Court, made him almost precipitate that Design; he advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with <hi>Ismael</hi> Bassa, and they resolved the business should be done whilst the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition of the Protector lasted, because he should be no obstacle to that Design. <hi>Levan,</hi> ever complaisant to his Wife, feigned to have for her more care than ordinary; and seeing her very melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, he conjured her, if she had any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to pleasure him, to seek her Cure by Divertisments, or some other way; and knowing how much she loved Hunting, he proposed to her that Recreation. The Princess, whose only desire it was to live well with her Husband, assented to it; and he ordered every thing should be got ready for the next day: The plot was that they should Hunt near the Castle
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:151309:60"/> of <hi>Phasia;</hi> and the new <hi>Bassa,</hi> who, as we have said, had a very fair House near it, was to Treat the Prince and Princess at it; where it would follow of course, that <hi>Homais</hi> would come, and pay her Devoir to the Princess of <hi>Colchis,</hi> with whom <hi>Levan</hi> designed she should return to Court. The Protector was not of the Company, his indisposition having not yet left him.</p>
               <p>They all mounted on Horse-back; that is to say, the Prince and Princess, <hi>Osman</hi> Visier, the Sultaness <hi>Selima, Ismael</hi> Bassa, with all the Nobility, and the <hi>Colchian</hi> and <hi>Abcan</hi> Ladies, that were of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess <hi>Bassima's</hi> Court.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Colchis,</hi> being the most impatient of Men, after he had seen a little of the Course, left the Company to follow after, and with <hi>Ismael</hi> Bassa galloped to the Castle of <hi>Phasia,</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to look upon the Fortifications. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais</hi> understanding of his arrival, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all her Women, and her Guards, went to meet him upon the Bridge: The Prince seemed surprized to see her, and having demanded, who she was, of those that followed him, <hi>Ismael</hi> Bassa with a feigned Gravity told him, she was Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:151309:61"/> of <hi>Libardian. Levan</hi> saluted her with much Respect, and conducted her back to the Palace in the Castle, where he was no sooner left without any other Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses than <hi>Ismael</hi> Bassa, but he threw himself at her Feet, and said all to her that could be expected from a Heart so passionate; and having received recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal assurances of her concern for him, her Chariot being made ready, he conducted her to it, and mounted himself on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, to go and Dine at <hi>Ismael</hi>'s House. <hi>Homais,</hi> as she said, was going to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her Devoir to the Princess of <hi>Colchis;</hi> her Guards attending her thither; who having had Orders, not to let her pass out of the Castle, durst not however dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with <hi>Levan,</hi> and contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with not forsaking her, believing she would return after the Entertainment was over, to repose again in the Castle.</p>
               <p>During this Affair, the unfortunate <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier,</hi> not able to support that Grief which oppress'd him, and yet not knowing how to dispossess himself of it, had not said any thing to the Persons in Company all the way they rode, but thinking inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly on his Divine Princess, he sigh'd in no other Accents; they came to <hi>Ismael</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:151309:61"/> Bassa's House before <hi>Levan,</hi> and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess <hi>Bassima,</hi> being wearied with Riding, laid her self upon a Bed in that Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they had conducted her to. She dismissed her Ladies of their Attendance, to refresh themselves for some moments; so that the <hi>Visier,</hi> who never abandoned her, found himself alone at the Beds-feet, without any witnesses of his passion, but that Divine Princess to whom it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress'd. He came to the side of the Bed where she lay, and kneeling by her, I continue to suffer for your Majesty, said he with much perplexity, and you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be cruel to me; I will dye this hour, to prevent the continuance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable Misfortunes; and to free my Divine Princess from Persecutions that she esteems offensive to her Glory, though the bright Heavens may attest the Innocency of my flames. The <hi>Visier</hi> paused here, fearing to incense her; but seeing that in the place of answering him, she only wept, and held a Handkerchief to her Eyes, to hinder him from seeing her weakness; Rich Tears, renewed the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier;</hi> is it possible that there can be any Misfortune upon Earth forcible enough to make you fall? Tell me, my Princess,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:151309:62"/> what it is that afflicts you: Must this Miserable dye, to expiate that Crime you so obligingly reprove me of? You have seen me long wonted to Sufferings, and Death is preferable to their continuance my charming <hi>Bassima,</hi> there is Glory in obeying you; behold in me the most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute of all your Slaves, and believe me, I will find that thing wholly impossible, that shall make me ineffectually receive your Commands. I doubt neither of your Good will, nor your Obedience (reply'd the Princess with the same sorrow) but it is not from you, my Lord, that they can receive redress; the Prince my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's inconstancy is the source of those Tears you see me shed, and in this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable state there is nothing besides, but what is forbiddden me. He is my Soveraign, interrupted the <hi>Visier;</hi> but the least of your Commands to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, should not make me esteem him as such: I say this to your Majesty, to assure you of the resignation I have for all things that you shall desire; and you may well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, Madam, that resolving to sacrifice my Life to your disdain, I should but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hesitate to offer any others to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; not but that I am assured of your

Ah, my Lord! answered the Princess, in letting her Hand fall near the <hi>Visier,</hi> how ruinous are you? and how much must I condemn Advice which I must never follow? My Heart is not raised above other Mortals, like them I have passion of Anger, and of Weakness; but all this can never make me Criminal; it is your part to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the promise you have made me, and mine, my Lord, to follow the Rules of my Duty. Ah! cry'd the <hi>Visier,</hi> all tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported with despair, this is not a time, when my Life is at stake, to tell me such cruel News; revoke that Order, my

Must I avow to you, that my Heart was never touched with that Tenderness for any, as it has been for you since the first Minute that I beheld you? Yes, my Lord, you bear not all the Misfortunes common to us both: I would never have told you this (and upon which there shall to other consequence depend, than saving that Life that is more estimable to me than all others) had not the infidelity of my Husband given me some disgust of him; but this is all you are ever to hope for, and dare not henceforward complain to me of your Sufferings, since that I acquaint you mine are incomparably more extraordinary, by how much my Glory, and the Customs of my Sex (which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be dispensed with by a Vertuous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess) ties me to more rigid Laws than yours. Love (my Charming Soveraign, reply'd the <hi>Visier,</hi> ready to sink with rapture) acknowledges no difference of

And in this Triumphant minute, how have I forgotten all my past Misfortunes? Redouble, if it be possible, this Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; tell me, you will no longer oppose the Testimonies of my passion, nor the good inclination of yours; hearken to my sighs, and let my extraordinary passion produce reciprocal effects in that Breast, already prepared to receive a favourable impression. I have done ill, I see, my Lord, interrupted the Princess coldly, in avowing for you any Tenderness; and you build very fantastick hopes upon an unsure Foundation; my good Opinion of you shall never make me Criminal: You are married, and I am not more free; you have Vertue, and I have Glory; let us not destroy so goodly a Fabrick, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late your flame by mine, we must silently suffer; though I avow to you, before all that we reverence, I could have lived with you preferrable to the highest Monarch in the Universe; but this our inclination is

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive; nor take it ill, if I Command you not any more to entertain me with your Love; I will say all for you that you can desire, and do you also do me this Justice in your Heart, as to think, never nothing but you could ever Rival my Glory; God and Man would be offended, should I do for you any more; my own Heart would no longer esteem you, should you desire it. The Princess could not finish the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, because she had notice, that the Prince was arrived with <hi>Homais;</hi> the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier</hi> begg'd leave to retire to compose himself; he passed then down another way into the Gardens, where he consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his Heart, what he was to hope or fear; he found the Princess tender be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expectation, and this gave him so much joy, that he long walked in the Garden without any other thought; Ah, said he aloud in the Transports of his Love, how incomparable is my Felicity! Charming <hi>Bassima,</hi> it suffices only that you continue your Bounties, to make me dye with a surfeit of Pleasure. As he finished these words, he entred an Arbor that was near, and did not presently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive (so great was his Transport) the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:151309:64"/> Sultaness <hi>Selima</hi> his Wife all in Tears, sitting upon the Turf, and leaning her Arm upon the Table. <hi>Osman</hi> started back, and found that she had apparently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard him; of all Persons in the World she was the least welcome to him at that moment; but desiring to avoid any Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with her, he was going out again, without enquiring into the cause of her Grief. <hi>Selima</hi> rising all in a rage, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued him out of the Arbor, Come back, Deceiver, cry'd she to him all incensed, come back, perfidious <hi>Osman,</hi> and give me at least some Reasons for thy Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and of thy Barbarity, who canst be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold me here ready to dye, without once satisfying thy self of the occasion, though thou knowest too well, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon Earth I adore so much as thee. I am always ready to Oblige you in any thing, reply'd the <hi>Visier,</hi> and I imagine not what moves you to call me Deceiver. Yes, false as thou art, interrupted she, all incensed, I have heard, I have seen all, that thou camest from saying, with the Princess of <hi>Colchis;</hi> and after this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, never speak to me more; just Heaven will Revenge me, and I only live to desire it. Do you consider well who
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:151309:65"/> you speak of, Madam, interrupted <hi>Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and that none are concern'd in this but your own Husband, and your Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Mistress? When they both betray me, answer'd the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> it is fit I lose all considerations for them: Then, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing her Discourse with much vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, she learnt him, how, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having any manner of suspicion, she heard from the next Gallery that joyn'd the Chamber, all that had been said by him and the Princess. And do not you find in it, Madam, said the <hi>Visier</hi> to her, that we are more unhappy than Criminal? You are more Treacherous than all, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd she, and I will no longer acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge you for my Lord; at these words she went out of the Arbour, and ran as fast as she could down the Walk, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to quit the Garden; the <hi>Visier</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took her, when she had made almost to the end, and catching hold of her, he kneeled upon her Petticoat, that she could not stir; For Gods sake, Madam, said he to her, out of breath, consider what you do, before you ruine me and the Princess of <hi>Colchis;</hi> I will love you as long as you live, and you may well be assured, that in that Intelligence of Friendship between
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:151309:65"/>
                  <hi>Bassima</hi> and my self, there is nothing Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal enough to wrong you in those Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces that are due only to you. The Treason is aimed at my Heart, retorted the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> and I can never forgive you. As she said these words, she endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to break from him, when she saw not far from her, the Prince and Princess of <hi>Colchis,</hi> with the Princess of <hi>Libar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> who were come into the same Walk. The <hi>Visier</hi> rose from his knees as soon as he saw them, and the <hi>Sultaness</hi> slightly saluting them, turned into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Walk; the <hi>Visier</hi> could not follow her, as he would have done, because the Prince called him, and presented him to <hi>Homais,</hi> I have promised to shew your Highness, said the Prince to her, the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier,</hi> whom you have so much commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A Person so extraordinary, reply'd <hi>Homais,</hi> can have nothing less said of him; but it is an uncommon thing, to see a Husband at the feet of his Wife, with the same earnestness as if he were a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and if I desired any thing, it should be to know what this extraordinary thing could be: Sure, added the Princess of <hi>Colchis,</hi> it must be worth knowing, and I desire the Information. You shall
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:151309:66"/> have it, Madam, answer'd the <hi>Visier,</hi> as soon as the <hi>Sultaness</hi> will give me leave to tell it. If that hinders, I'le go my self and seek her, reply'd <hi>Homais;</hi> and assuring my self of so much power over my Husband's Sister, I will instantly return with her. At these words she gave her Hand to <hi>Ismael,</hi> who had just before given her a short whisper, to tell her from <hi>Selima,</hi> that she had something of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to say to her, and expected her in an Arbor not far off. The Prince of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis</hi> saw her go, without daring to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her, for fear of his Wife; and the <hi>Visier,</hi> who was more perplexed than was ever any Man, would have given his Life to hinder Discourse between the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taness</hi> and the Princess of <hi>Libardian,</hi> whom he had reason to believe hated him from what had formerly passed between them; he knew not whether he had best follow her, and the Princess of <hi>Colchis,</hi> who had remained in that Chamber to receive <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais,</hi> quickly found that there was some more than ordinary, intelligence between that fair Cousin and the Amorous Prince her Husband, and was descending into the Garden on purpose to find the <hi>Visier,</hi> to oblige him to make his Remarks, and to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:151309:66"/> tell her his Opinion of them; but when she saw him in that posture, at the feet of his Wife, the jealousie she had of the Prince, yielded in part to that she was possessed with for her Lover; and turning to him, seeing him in so strange a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siveness, after the departure of <hi>Homais,</hi> Thou hast ill required (said she to him softly, that the Prince her Husband should not hear) that Tenderness I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for thee; <hi>Selima</hi> Triumphs over my weakness, which thou hast made her acquainted with, and ye both scorn your Soveraign; if I cannot hate thee, I will at least not love thee; and I warn thee, never again to speak to me: At these words she turn'd to the Prince, and gave him her hand, making a sign to the <hi>Visier</hi> to go off, which he did, the most sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, and the most lost Man alive.</p>
               <p>Mean time, the enraged <hi>Sultaness</hi> bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting with Revenge and Jealousie, seeing <hi>Homais</hi> in the Garden, whom she su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected had a kindness for the <hi>Visier;</hi> she resolved to tell her what had pass'd between him and the Princess of <hi>Colchis,</hi> that she might tell it the Prince of <hi>Libar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.</hi> As soon as she turned into that Walk, she met with <hi>Ismael,</hi> whom she
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:151309:67"/> sent, as has been related, to fetch the fair <hi>Homais</hi> to her; they no sooner met in the appointed Arbor, but <hi>Selima</hi> embracing her with much distraction, related to her every word of that Conversation the <hi>Visier</hi> had held with <hi>Bassima: Homais</hi> would not at first believe it, till the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taness</hi> reiterated it to her: And I conjure you, added she at last, not to say any thing of it but to the Prince my Brother; you may both together, perhaps, do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for my repose: But what do I say? I am never to hope for any; I go this minute to reside in the uttermost Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of my Brother's Territories, never again to behold that false Man, of whose Fortune, maugre his Perjury, I desire the Protector to be careful; adieu, my dear Sister, I hazard nothing in acquainting you with this Secret; and I recommend to you and my Brother, that Husband whom I love above my Life, and yet whom I must never see again. As she fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished these words, she went out of the Arbor, with such an Air, as made the cruel <hi>Homais</hi> have some pity upon her. <hi>Selima</hi> found <hi>Ismael</hi> at the entrance, and with his assistance got to Horse, with her People; and being already in the Prince
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:151309:67"/> her Brother's Territories, she resolved not to return to <hi>Colchis,</hi> but rode forward to another Castle in <hi>Libardian,</hi> whither she intended to retire her self. But the unfortunate <hi>Visier,</hi> who had lately thought himself the happiest Person breathing, by a turn of Destiny, found his Misery as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable as his Joy; his Wife had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered him, his Princess whom he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored had accused and banished him. <hi>Homais,</hi> that Enemy to his Fortune, was returned, and what was worst, shared the Secret of the <hi>Sultaness,</hi> as he did not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. With these Thoughts he wandred he knew not where, and Fortune con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted his steps into that same Arbor where <hi>Homais</hi> was alone; she no sooner saw him enter, but casting her Eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him with disdain, Your Lordship is mistaken, said she to him, the Princess of <hi>Colchis,</hi> whom you undoubtedly seek, is not here. I neither sought the one nor the other, Madam, replied the <hi>Visier;</hi> and perhaps I disturb your Highness, whom I see doubtless in expectation of a more happy Lover. As much in haste as you are, my Lord <hi>Visier,</hi> interrupted she, stay to receive my Thanks for the favour of your last Letter; I shall never forget it, at
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:151309:68"/> least till I have requited it. You owe me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed something, Madam, answered he, for passing by without that Revenge, which any other less Gallant than my self would perhaps have taken, Falshoods that my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour rather than my Inclination has resen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; I owe too much to my Lord Protector, to cast my Eyes upon the Princess he has honoured with his Affection. The Prince my Husband, it seems, is much obliged to you, replied <hi>Homais,</hi> but he would be yet more, if you had a little more concern for the <hi>Sultaness</hi> his Sister, and for the Prince his Nephew: Once more, my Lord, you see the Princess of <hi>Colchis</hi> is not here; and it is best for me to retire, to leave you to the liberty of the place; possibly she may not be long absent, it becomes a Gentleman to be first upon the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Rather, Madam, returned the <hi>Visier,</hi> it belongs to me to retire; I have not forgot the Offices I did you, when I was shut in your Closet; I pretend not to incommode you, and I had at first with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, if you had not with-held me. As he finished these words, they saw the Princess of <hi>Colchis</hi> appear at the end of a Walk that led to that Arbor. Well, my Lord, renewed <hi>Homais,</hi> have I not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin'd
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:151309:68"/> right? but I'll leave you to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. As she finished these words, she got out of the <hi>Visier</hi>'s arms, that strove to hold her, and turning hastily into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Walk, where she was still in sight of <hi>Bassima</hi> and <hi>Osman,</hi> she met the Prince of <hi>Colchis,</hi> who was seeking her; he saw only with the Eyes of Love, and beheld not the Princess, and the <hi>Visier</hi> so near him, only the charming <hi>Homais,</hi> whom he ran to meet, and catching her in his arms, Why, my amiable Cousin, said he aloud, have you so long abandon'd me? The Princess his Wife seeing this cruel action, Ah, how I am betray'd by all, said she, in coming to the Prince! <hi>Levan</hi> struck as with thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at that voice, staid not to hear her Complaints, but bidding the <hi>Visier</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct her in, he himself led <hi>Homais;</hi> and calling all his People about him, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately got to horse, and with the Princess of <hi>Libardian,</hi> and the afflicted <hi>Bassima,</hi> returned to the Castle of <hi>Rucs,</hi> commanding his Wife and the <hi>Visier</hi> not to say any thing to the Protector of what had passed.</p>
               <p>What a Night was this for these four Illustrious Persons! <hi>Homais</hi> found an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Reception from the Protector,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:151309:69"/> to whom she related the Adventure of the <hi>Sultaness:</hi> He knew not well what to think of it, but conjured her not to say any thing to the Prince of it; he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not of her coming to Court, and told her that she must resolve to return with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two days. She received this Sentence as her Doom, and parting with him in some anger, she went to those Lodgings that had heen prepared for her, taking the pretence of his Indisposition for not passing the Night with him: And as she had before agreed with the Prince, she sent to give him an account of what her Husband had said to her. <hi>Levan</hi> came alone with <hi>Ismael</hi> not long after, without light or noise to her Chamber, where she was already in Bed; the young <hi>Bassa</hi> was sent to secure any surprizal from the Quarter where the Protector was lodg'd: The Room was but enlightned with one single Taper: <hi>Homais</hi> became nothing better than her Night-dress; and she had been often told, that she looked handsomest in Bed: The Prince found her to his mind in that state, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times embraced her as she lay: But what do you think, my Lord, she answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Princess will say after the

I forbid you to do it, my dear Cousin, replied the amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Prince; I would deny you to the Gods, should they ask you of me; I hate my Wife, since I have found out her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious humour. Ah, my Lord, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted <hi>Homais,</hi> if your Majesty knew all, you would hate her much more for being too commodious; but the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor has forbidden me to relate to you that which I think in Honour you should know; and if your Highness commands me, I will tell it to you. If it be heinous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to destroy her, returned the Prince, I would not be ignorant of it; for I am resolved to make use of the first pretence to ruine her; I desire nothing more than to get rid of her, that I may enjoy my charming <hi>Homais</hi> at liberty. Then she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to him with aggravation all that <hi>Selima</hi> had told her, and the reason of her retiring her self. The Prince was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported with rage and choler at this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and reflecting certain things in his mind, They have abused me, whispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he to <hi>Homais;</hi> and I remember well,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:151309:70"/> that <hi>Osman</hi> the Traytor was surprized when he first saw the Picture of <hi>Bassima.</hi> Nay, my Lord, rejoyned <hi>Homais,</hi> I am informed, that this Intelligence began be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Peace was concluded; and if you examine him, you will find him guilty in point of Interest, as well as that of Love; this Princess was his Prisoner of War, whom he took in a Forest, with thirty other Ladies, some days before the last Battel was fought; and upon a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vado, returned her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

You have said enough of State, my dear Cousin, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the Prince, pressing her hand, the Villain shall die, and the Trayteress shall be punished with infamy; and this shall not be long deferred; but, my charming Princess, will you do nothing for me? behold how passionately I love you! there is nothing I can deny you; what hinders us from being this Night happier than the Gods themselves? Honour, my dear Prince, returned she with a sigh, forbids me
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:151309:70"/> to do it; ah, reconcile my Glory to my Flame, and I shall willingly receive you. And never any other way, replied the Prince? Can you ruine what you created, and leave me languishing and cold? shew me only a prospect of Heaven, and forbid me the hopes of enjoying it? This is what I am obliged to do, answer'd <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais,</hi> though it cost me my Life; it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to die with Honour, than live with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy. But, interrupted the Prince, when I have rejected that Trayteress my Wife, will you not yield to marry me, maugre my Uncle's title to you? answer me, my fair Cousin; I must see you mine, or you must see me dead: How charming are you, and how sensible is my Heart of those Graces that adorn you! When <hi>Bassima</hi> is no longer in my Throne, nor in my Bed, will you not yield that I should place you there? How destructive are you, my dear Cousin? returned <hi>Homais;</hi> and how little shall I consider, for your sake, any thing but my Vertue? my Father con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained me to give my hand to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, whom I have ever hated; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my Beauty with nothing but Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and solitude; he takes my Heart from that Person to whom it is destin'd
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:151309:71"/> a Sacrifice; he pretends to deny me for ever the sight of you, why does he not rather command my Death? how much easier would it be to obey him? for I can die, my Lord, but I can never acquit you. Neither shall you, my charming Cousin, replied the amorous Prince; my Uncle shall know I stand not in need any longer of his Government; he shall yield you to me, or I will dispeople as well <hi>Colchis</hi> as his <hi>Libardian,</hi> and leave not a person alive in either of the Kingdoms to dispute our Felicities; I am concern'd in Honour that the <hi>Visier</hi> should die, and <hi>Bassima</hi> shall be punish'd; yes, my Cousin, and then you shall not deny to be mine. When this is effected, answer'd the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, I will be yours; that is to say, I will marry you; I think it very laudable for me to please my self, after having once been sacrificed to the Will of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:151309:71"/> accidents of that fatal day; her suspicions were true, the Prince her Husband was false to her, and was become incestuously amorous of his Uncle's Wife; but it was the falsness of the <hi>Visier</hi> that most sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly touched her; What, said she to her self, that Man for whom I have done and suffered so much, is it possible he should be perfidious! ah, no; and we did ill not to hear the Reasons he would perhaps have given us.

                     <p>IF it were not absolutely necessary, Madam, for your concerns, that I should break the silence you undeservedly enjoyned me, I would have fled to death rather than disobey'd you; but as long as any danger threatens my divine Princess, it is necessary that I warn her of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:151309:72"/> it: <hi>Selima,</hi> whom you saw me kneel to, fatally over-heard all our Discourse, it was that that made me her suppliant; for very far from betraying you, I sought to secure you: <hi>Homais</hi> has been acquainted with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, though I know not whether it will go any further: See, Madam, if you had reason to condemn me; Ah, is this the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness you promised me? Is this the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, this the Preference? I am retiring from this Fatal Court, and go to languish in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, to complain to Insensibles, to the Rocks and Trees, of my obdurate Princess; your Disdain only will finish my Life; I reject the assistance of Sword, or Poyson, my Despair is alone more violent than them; though could I but once see my Soveraign before I dye for her, to taste those Joys that would anticipate the possession of Heaven, I should esteem Death only as a short Parenthesis between Paradise and her, and fly to him without feeling the Tormentor: All is easie that one suffers for you, and how cruel soever they in reality are, there is Delight and Glory in those Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>

               </floatingText>
               <p>The Princess no sooner finished the reading of this Letter, but laying it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Table, she traversed the Chamber
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:151309:72"/> with some disturbance; at length, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing her thoughts, she cast her Eyes upon the Eunuch, Whence had you this Letter, said she to him, and where is the <hi>Visier?</hi> He waits not far off upon the Terrass, Madam, answer'd the Eunuch, and begs admittance of your Majesty. I cannot allow him it at this time, she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, but you may tell him, that my Anger is vanish'd. Ah! interrupted the <hi>Visier,</hi> entring from that Door which opened upon that Terrass, how agreeable is that voice! Confirm it, my Princess, and let us Arm our selves against all Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. Ah, my Lord, answer'd she, do you well consider what Advantage you give our Enemies, should they know of this interview? And what account shall I make of receiving a Lover, and a Subject into my Chamber by Night, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the consent and knowledge of my Husband? You owe him nothing, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, reply'd <hi>Osman;</hi> nor am I any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger engaged to <hi>Selima;</hi> let us renounce them both, as they have abandon'd us: The Prince of <hi>Libardian</hi> has related to me all our Discourse, as he had it from <hi>Homais;</hi> and though he has conjur'd her to say nothing of it, she loves <hi>Levan</hi> too
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:151309:73"/> well, to obey the Protector. My Heart tells me, that if we remain till to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, the mischief will be unavoidable; let us secure our selves then, whilst we have time; I have Horses and Chariots in readiness for your Flight, If you will agree that we take it together: The King your Father will afford you a secure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; and as for me, I am assured of one at the Port, if I please to retire to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople:</hi> It is certain that your Husband is a passionate Lover of <hi>Homais,</hi> and she will ruine us to advance her self; fly whilst it's dark, and let me have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being your Conductor. If I were culpable indeed, reply'd the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, I should dispose my self to follow your Advice; but when I have no other Crimes but my Misfortunes, I see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that should oblige me to shun them; and to be innocent, is better than to be happy, if we cannot buy that Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness but with the loss of our Innocency. Ah, my fair Princess, he answer'd, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself upon his knees, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing hers with an addition of Passion and Despair, by reposing too much confidence in your Innocency, you pronounce the Sentence of your Death: Know well,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:151309:73"/> that you shall be condemn'd without hearing; and those Persons, whose In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest so much it is to remove you, will never consider the lawfulness or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the business. All this, reply'd the Princess, may probably come to pass, and I question not but that my Husband aims at my Life; I will willingly sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it to him, so he hurt not my Fame; but I fear the ruine of the one, will be the consequent of both; and they will begin my Death, by blasting that Glory, which I have always been so zealous to preserve entire; and yet, my Lord, though I see this misery coming on very fast, I cannot resolve to seek any refuge against it; and I so firmly believe a Destiny in our Actions, that it will be in vain for me to avoid mine: Leave me then to suffer that which my hard Fate has prepared for me; it is not just that I should involve you in my ruine, you are more innocent than I am, for I know my self not freed from what the vertuous call culpable; I have lov'd a Man not my Husband, I have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, I have avow'd it to him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pined at Fortune, for not making me the Present of a Heart, when I had been in a capacity to receive it; a Heart, I say, that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:151309:74"/> I value more than I ought, and for which I must suffer Death, or Shame. A Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Tears stopt the course of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses words, and the <hi>Visier,</hi> who bore her Company in that sad Employment, maugre the greatness of his Courage, could not say any thing to mitigate her Affliction. At length <hi>Bassima</hi> having wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped away her Tears, and coming near the <hi>Visier,</hi> My Lord, said she to him, since you cannot be ignorant how dear you are to me, I would have you secure my Repose, by putting your Person out of danger; take your way to the <hi>Port,</hi> sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite the <hi>Sultan</hi> for me, and endeavour to make him the Arbitrator of my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny; my Husband fears the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Arms, and if the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> commands him to live well with me, he dares not disobey; fear not that in the interim any misfortune should befall me, if <hi>Levan</hi> has any Jealousie, he will temper it better, than to ruine an illustrious Princess as I am: But I will not warrant you, my Lord, that if you remain in this Court, you can be secure; he will undoubtedly cause you to be murdered, after which I should have but little satisfaction in Life. Depart then, <hi>Osman,</hi> continued she, embracing him with
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:151309:74"/> an eminent disorder, and boast that you are the only Person could create in me so much weakness as this. Your Majesty, reply'd the <hi>Visier,</hi> must allow me not to abandon you; and since you do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to save your self by flight, I will stay in <hi>Colchis</hi> and perish with you. They had a great deal of other Discourse to this effect, when they saw the Prince of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardian</hi> enter the Chamber very pale, and much astonished: Innocent and unhappy Lovers, said he to them, refuse not a Companion in misfortune, but assist a miserable Prince in the most deplorable extremity it is possible for one to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. That Woman whom I have mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried dishonours me; <hi>Levan</hi> is this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with her, and nothing but want of power to revenge my self, makes me thus tamely suffer those Criminal Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces: Fly, beautiful Princess, they have doom'd you to Sufferings; but leave me the <hi>Visier</hi> to assist me in our common and just Vengeance. Ah, Sir, answer'd <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sima,</hi> I must resist this Advice; Heaven will surely limit our Distress, and I am resolved to abide by the most cruel effects of an unjust Anger, and an unreasonable Jealousie. As they were thus debating,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:151309:75"/> one of the Protector's Spies came to give him Advice, that the Prince of <hi>Colchis</hi> was return'd from <hi>Homais,</hi> to his own Lodging: Assist me, <hi>Osman,</hi> renewed the Prince of <hi>Libardian,</hi> in the just design of regaining my Wife. If you please, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I warrant you safe Protection in <hi>Libardian,</hi> and you shall instantly depart with <hi>Homais,</hi> whom I am going to seize upon; I have already sent Orders to my Officers to Arm themselves, and the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they Command, to defend my Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, should my ungrateful Rival invade me, as I apprehend; resist no longer, abandon a cruel Tyrant, and I solemnly promise you, to die in your Defence. Lead me where you please, Sir, reply'd the Princess, I hesitate not; and what my Vertue would not have me bestow upon the <hi>Visier,</hi> desire of safety makes me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept from you. Then they all went softly to the Chamber of <hi>Homais,</hi> which the <hi>Visier</hi> easily forced, none of the Guards being within hearing; and the Protector having caused her to dress her self, led her down unwillingly, though she could not resist him, and put her with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of <hi>Colebis</hi> into a Chariot that waited. Himself, the <hi>Visier,</hi> and their People,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:151309:75"/> mounting their Horses, took a full gallop to the Castle of <hi>Phasia,</hi> where being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, they conducted <hi>Bassima</hi> to the best Lodgings, and remitted <hi>Homais</hi> a close Prisoner to hers.</p>
               <p>After some necessary Orders for the securing the Castle, the Prince of <hi>Libar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> came to his Wife, and casting a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected look upon her, mingled with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, How have I deserved, Madam, to be betraied by you? Have I been guilty in point of Tenderness? or was there other Interest in my Marriage, than what arose from possessing so fair a Person? Tell me then, ungrateful Woman, do you merit other than Death from me? And is it not just that I should rob thee of my Heart, a Present which thou hast no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to pretend to? Condemn me not without hearing, Sir, interrupted the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, casting her self at his Feet, I adore you, and no Person alive has any Interest in <hi>Homais</hi> but your self; I have never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traid you, <hi>Levan</hi> is indeed touched with my Beauty, but if he loves, he also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairs; and last Night, when he visited me in my Bed, without my knowledge or permission, I treated him as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Quality, as his flame is below his
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:151309:76"/> Duty: Believe me, Sir, and restore me to your Love; let me suffer Imprisonment, and Chains, provided you rob me not of your Esteem; but rifled of that, what pleasure can there be for me in this Life? Be touched with my pain, and if my Beauty has lost its lustre, and its power, let my Innocence be justified, and no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger suspect a Vertue, which Heaven can testifie: The Prince, who occasioned your suspicions, shall never again behold me. Are you still insensible? Do I still find you cold? Is it true, that you have no love for me? Let me then, as I have often sworn, not survive so fatal a period to my Happiness; my Justification finds no Credit, it is by my Death that I must be cleared; in saying these words she snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Husband's Poyniard, with which she was going to wound her self, had he not prevented her; but she would not restore it to him, till he promised to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what she had said, to forgive Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, and no longer to hold her Criminal; after which, she made use of all her Power over him, and so prevail'd, that he took in the Poison of her Cares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and return'd them with his, to all the degree of fondness that had ever past
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:151309:76"/> between them. He left her at perfect Liberty, and bid her visit the Princess: She kept him with her, to prevent his looking after the Affairs of the Castle, that the Prince of <hi>Colchis,</hi> whom she knew would pursue them, might surprize it, if possible; but seeing she must let him depart, she repeated those Vows she had made him. Let us talk no more of what is past, reply'd he, it is sufficient you have promised me never to fall again; Hove you to that degree of fondness, that should you again betray me, it would cost me my Life; my despair would exceed all my other Passions; and by how much you would be baser than all other Women, so much would my Love surpass my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments; and I must die for you, when I shall not be suffer'd to live with you; preserve me then, my Dear, and suffer not your perfectest adorer to be unhappy. After this, with reiterated assurances of Tenderness, he departed, and she imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately set her self to write to the Prince of <hi>Colchis.</hi> Her Note was thus.</p>

               <p>She sent this by the Slave who had carried her first; he took the Advantage of the Night, and unseen got over the Walls. <hi>Homais</hi> waited the effect with an impatience suitable to her Temper. She was now to visit the Princess, and eat with her; and her wicked Spirit car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying her very far, she imagined it easie to Poison her; the Prince of <hi>Colchis,</hi> she thought, would not dare to put her to Death, and till she was removed, her Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:151309:77"/> would never be gratify'd: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting then nothing but what that sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested, she took a large Diamond, and pounding it very small, called to her a trusty Confident, who was to give the Princess her Drink, and order'd him to administer the fatal Potion. It is to be avow'd, that in all parts of the Earth Villains are not wanting; and one shall almost every where find Persons, who for Reward and Honours, will stick at nothing; of this Nature was him <hi>Homais</hi> employ'd; he took an Oath of Secrecy, and too faithfully discharged his Promise. That hour did the unfortunate Princess drink her last, without any suspicion of the Treason. Never was she more amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the wicked <hi>Homais,</hi> who saw it administred, trembled and look'd pale at the horridness of the Fact. After Supper, the Prince of <hi>Libardian,</hi> remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Government of the Castle to the <hi>Visier,</hi> took Horse, to go and meet his Forces, and to give Orders for new Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies. He took a tender farewell of his Wife, and shed some Tears upon that ungrateful Bosom, that desired nothing more than his ruine.</p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:151309:78"/>
               <p>An hour before day, the Prince of <hi>Colchis,</hi> with Six Thousand Horse, and Ten Thousand Foot, arrived, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguer'd the Castle. The Slave <hi>Homais</hi> had sent, met him upon the way; <hi>Levan,</hi> furious as a Lion, had no sooner been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the flight of his Wife, and Uncle, his Mistress, and the <hi>Visier,</hi> but assembling all his Forces which lay en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped about the Castle of <hi>Rucs,</hi> he marched with all imaginable haste to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Frontiers. The Letter of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais</hi> was what added wings to his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize. He sat down before the Castle, and having summon'd it in vain, he gave Orders, to Storm it, knowing well it could not hold out an hour. The <hi>Visier</hi> was then with the Princess, and upon this Advice, taking a tender farewel of her, he was going where his Honour called him, resolving to die, rather than yield the place; but he was met upon the great Stairs by <hi>Homais,</hi> and part of the Garrion-Soldiers, that served for her Guard. Yield thy self, <hi>Osman,</hi> said she to him, my Faction has prevail'd, the Prince of <hi>Colchis</hi> is entring, I am Master here, and thou my Prisoner. Shameless, Princess, reply'd the <hi>Visier,</hi> hast thou no
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:151309:78"/> Honour nor Fidelity to thy Husband? At these words he drew his Sword, and kill'd the most advanced, which was the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer that commanded; but being alone, he found it impossible to prevail, he heard the loud shouts of the Prince's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who were entred the Castle; so that resolving to die at the feet of his Princess, he retreated back to the Gallery that led to her Lodging. <hi>Homais</hi> perceiving his intent, did not pursue him; her Policy suggesting to her, he would appear more culpable to the Prince of <hi>Colchis,</hi> when found alone with <hi>Bassima.</hi> So leaving a strong Guard upon the Appartment, she went her self to meet the Conqueror.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Osman</hi> entring the Chamber, found the Princess fainting upon a Couch, the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son began feebly to operate, which joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her Fears, carried her into Fits: We are fast, said the <hi>Visier,</hi> supporting her in his Arms; <hi>Homais</hi> has betray'd us, the Soldiers are revolted, the Prince is entring, and will in a minute be with us; let us employ, my Princess, the time we have left, in revenging our selves by the highest Joys; send me not unblest to the shades: They have five Doors to force, which I took care to shut after me, before
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:151309:79"/> they enter this; we have leisure for a taste of Happiness; prevent the cruel Death my Enemies design me, by a more pleasing one; I promise my self, my Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, in enjoying you, though it be amidst all this Tumult and Horror, so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, that if I survive the Minute to suffer the effecs of my Enemy's Sword, it will he without feeling the smart, the extasie will possess all my Faculties; and if you love me, as you have said, you ought to prevent the pains of Death, or, which is worse, those I shall find by your denyal: Then kissing her Mouth with all the eagerness of a passionate Adorer, They conclude me Happy, my Princess, why will yau not make me so? After Ages will not know our Innocence; and is it not the same thing to be culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as to be thought so? We have no time to lose, we hear them already for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Door that leads to this Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; convince me that you have truly lov'd, and in this last moment of Life oppose me not with a shadow of Vertue, only known to our selves: The World has already condemned us, let us deserve their censure, and make my Destiny en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied by all succeeding Lovers, that have
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:151309:79"/> a taste agreeable to mine. Ruine me not, my Lord, reply'd the Princess, embracing him; command your Passions, and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate me in self-denial; the just Heavens will not suffer us to die whilst we are Innocent: I must forbid your Hopes, for were there not an after-unhappiness, which I see your Love has excluded from your Memory, that Fidelity I owe my Husband, that veneration I have for Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and the Peace of a good Conscience, are of force enough to make me refuse your unjust desires: Regulate your flame by mine, and consider a transitory mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is of little weight, compared to Eternal Happiness; we ought only now to think of dying, and I promise, that your Destiny shall be mine. Then lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Face to his, we must separate my dear <hi>Osman,</hi> you have brought my Vertue to a cruel Tryal, and held it, for some moments, in suspense. 'Tis enough, answer'd he, you hate, or at least treat me as if you did: Farewel, cruel Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess; we must indeed separate for ever: I go to die, and you to the Embraces of a Husband, whom you love a thousand times beyond me. Destroy me not by this inhumanity, reply'd she, in retaining
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:151309:80"/> him; What would have me to do? Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie, Madam, that certain Maxim, <hi>That no Woman can be in Love, and be discreet.</hi> Agree, Sir, to that unalterable one, <hi>That ceasing to Estiem; we forget to Love.</hi> And though it be granted, that Opinion shares deep in that Passion, yet is a true flame much beholden to the Merit of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son adored; and it ows to it all its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy. I am now dying, as you see, but were my fears more remote, my Health perfecter, my Vertue would not be weaker; resign your Passion, and cease this extravagant Request; we hardly hear what we speak to each other, for the noise of our Enemies Swords, and the violence they use to get us into their Power. Is this a time to change Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence into Guilt? Ah! protect my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and lete us only think, that we must never meet again. Adieu then, vertuous and Charming Princess, forgive the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of my desires; I will regulate them henceforward, live happy in the Embraces of your Husband, and bestow some Tears upon my Death. Rather, she reply'd, you would live to regret mine; they are coming, one last Embrace, preserve your Heart for me, and let us die Happy, for
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:151309:80"/> we die Innocent. Here the Door was force open, and the Prince <hi>Colchis</hi> entred with a furious Aspect. Take the Adulteress, said he, and let me kill the Traitor. At these words he ran furiously. at the <hi>Visier; Osman</hi> warded the blow, but at the same time was wounded behind, and quickly born to the Ground by the Soldiers. Carry him to the Dungeon of the Castle, cry'd <hi>Levan;</hi> load him with Irons, let not the Villain have Meat or Rest, till the hour of his Death. And for you, Madam, turning to <hi>Bassima,</hi> my Council shall determine your Fate; if I considered my just Resentments, and not your being Daughter to a King, you should die this moment, to clear my Honour. Here he commanded her to be taken away, and would not hear speak. Not long after, he assembled his Council, and decreed, She should be sent home to the King her Father, with her Hands and Nose cut off, and her Eyes put out. See if ever Cruelty proceeded further; the most Charming, most Innocent, and most Vertuous Princess of the Earth, having a Sentence past upon her more rigid than a Criminal could have merited. But she, too fair to suffer so unjust a Destiny, died that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:151309:81"/> day (of the Poison <hi>Homais</hi> had given her) the moment after she had heard the discharge of that Cannon, in which, by the cruel Order of the Prince of <hi>Colchis, Osman</hi> was cram'd alive, and shot off in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Air, so that his Carkass shatter'd into a thousand pieces.</p>
               <p>The unfortunate Prince of <hi>Libardian</hi> escaped, as we have said, no sooner heard the sad Catastrophe, with the second fall of his Wife, but he retired himself to the utmost Limits of his Territories, and put himself and his Train into close Mourning for fourscore days, for the loss of his faithless Wife; then Arming all his People, he marched to receive his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Cousin, who pursued him with his Conquering Army. The wretched Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, whose pains could be only eased by Death, maintain'd the Fight for some time with great Animosity; but seeing his hopes of Victory as desperate as those of his Love and Honour, he engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self amongst the thickest of his Enemies, and upon their Sword-points found in his Death a rest from all his Misfortunes.</p>
               <p>The end of all things of this Nature, I know well, ought to be a Punishment of Vice, and Reward of Vertue; but
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:151309:81"/> Truth being the thing that in all my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings chiefly animates my Pen, I knew not well how to dispense my self from relating it as in reality it was. The wicked <hi>Homais</hi> was not long unmarried, and being the source of all the Injustice committed by <hi>Levan,</hi> she likewise reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them upon him; he died by Poison, which she administred, to make room for the Coronation of her Son <hi>Alexander,</hi> and her own Regency; ungratefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paying all the Kindness and Fondness of that poor Prince, whom she had ruined. Ought not Ladies then, to preserve their Vertue with care, for that once violated, what Crimes are they not guilty of? Whereas on the other side, it is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult for a Woman to be Criminal and Chaste.</p>
